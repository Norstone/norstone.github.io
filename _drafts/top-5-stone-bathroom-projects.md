Before the advent of porcelain and ceramic tile and other non porous surface materials, natural stone was probably the most popular surface material to be used in bathrooms, going all the way back to the bath houses of ancient Rome and the Middle East. While bathrooms have gotten a lot more private these days, the use of natural stone remains a mark of a quality bathroom with high end finishes. We've assembled this list of our Top 5 stone bathrooms featuring our natural stone veneer products to share with you today to explore what we think makes a bathroom great. Let's get started!

Our first stone bathroom project is all about the color, that color being white. White is a great color to design bathrooms with because it evokes cleanliness which is an important feeling to create in the design of any bathroom. This bathroom features a free standing tub with traditional curves surrounded by a stacked stone wall of Norstone White Rock Panels. The White Rock Panels look a little dark in the light of this small room, which actually ends up working perfectly with the light grey accent towels and mats of the space.

Speaking of grey, our second stone bathroom features our Grey Lynia Interlocking Stone tile used as a backsplash and decorative feature wall behind the a modern vanity. The stone in this application is grey basalt, which is honed and cut into interlocking strips that are laid as a mesh mounted mosaic and then grouted. The design of the interlocking stone tile and the smooth polished finish fit right into the modern vibe created here with the vanity, sinks, mirrors and light fixtures. The stone in this application will also be super functional and will easily stand up over time to the routine cleaning that this sort of area sees as part of daily use.

Our third stone bathroom we love for the creative use of the stacked stone panels as accents on both the vanity backsplash and the large walk in shower. Most of the time we see our natural stone panel products create the primary color pallete in a given space, so it's cool to see how this bathroom was designed using the stacked stone panels as accents in both texture and color to the base stone look tile.

Our fourth stone bathroom sticks with our stacked stone rock panel products, this time used as part of a massive walk in shower feature wall. This photo taken from outside the shower shows the entrance to the large walk in shower, which is on the other side of the wall from the vanity. Norstone Charcoal Stacked Stone Rock Panels are used to bridge the space from the main part of the bathroom into the massive shower stall itself. The contrasting black and white color pallete of this space is a perfect fit for the modern linear geometry of the stacked stone panels and the clean lines of the vanity and sink.

Our fifth and favorite stone bathroom project is this beautiful modern bathroom in Dallas, TX featuring our Aksent 3D stone panels. There's so much subtle detail packed into this small space we could easily write a whole article about, but the thing that stand out the most to us is the creative use of the stone on both the inside and outside of the space. The glass wall creates the illusion of being outside, with just a layer of clear glass between you sitting in a comfortable soaking tub and the private backyard. While that feeling might not be for everyone, it most certainly creates a luxurious feel to the space.

We hope you enjoyed having a look at some of our favorite stone bathroom projects where our products have been used in a variety of different applications.
