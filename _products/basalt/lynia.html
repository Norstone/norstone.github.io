    <p><em>For more detailed installation instructions, please visit our <a href="/how-to-install-stacked-stone">installation guide</a>.</em></p>
    <h4 class="color-primary">Installations</h4>
    <p>Lynia Tiles are a modern mosaic wall tile both in look, as well as installation. Each tile unit consists of 9 strips mounted on a mat to for ease of installation. Similar to any standard natural stone wall tile installation, the working surface should
      be a prepared cementitious substrate, most often cement board. The tile mats are fixed to the wall using a polymer modified tile thinset and then grouted with un-sanded grout. Like most natural stones, Lynia IL Tiles are designed to be cut on a
      tile wet saw.</p>
    <p>Wherever Lynia IL Tiles are used, the installation experience will be similar to other mat mounted tile products, which offer quick installation and consistent grout lines and spacing.</p>
    <h4>Natural Stone Sealer</h4>
    <p>Marble and Basalt are porous natural stones, thus they easily attracts and retains oils, dirt, and other contaminants. Norstone recommends taking the necessary precautions during handling and installation to keep the tiles clean and sealing all Lynia IL Tile applications with
      a water based, penetrating natural stone sealer once complete. Natural stone sealers have different characteristics as it relates to color enhancement and sheen, so please test any sealer prior to application on a scrap piece of stone or in an inconspicuous
      area.</p>
