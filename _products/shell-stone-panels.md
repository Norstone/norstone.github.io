## The Basalt 3D Tile Collection
{:.xx-large .color-primary}

### _Every Stone, Meticulously Set By Hand._
{:.medium .color-secondary}

Comprised of precision-cut blocks of Basalt stone, popularly known as Lava stone, our new interlocking tiles are hand-assembled with absolute & exacting standards. The result is a thin stone veneer so refined - so perfectly linear - that a completed installation will leave you with a new feeling of modernity and class. These thin stone tiles are perfect for contemporary commercial and residential facades, retaining walls, broad feature walls, and tall [stone fireplaces](/gallery/application/fireplace). Basalt 3D Tiles are available in our two proprietary Basalt colors: [Ash Grey](/products/basalt-stone-panels/ash-grey-stone/) and [Ebony](/products/basalt-stone-panels/black-stone/).

### Interlocking Ends Ensure a Seamless Installation. Every Time.
{:.medium .color-secondary}

Basalt 3D Tiles offer a "stepped" interlocking edge profile whereby one panel will interlock tightly into its neighboring panel. This system eliminates vertical seams, providing a clean, seamless look across your wall while still leveraging the easy to install nature of a panel system.

### One Corner System to Rule Them All.
{:.medium .color-secondary}

Basalt 3D Tiles incorporate Norstone's World-Class two-part, finger-jointed corner system. Saving every project the head-ache of having to miter their corners, this two-piece system offers a hassle free, interlocking installation, providing a look so seamless that it preserves the authentic nature of the stone. Because they require little skill on the part of the contractors fixing our rock panels to a wall, they significantly reduce installation time and onsite labor costs, especially when compared to the time and skill involved in cutting and forming mitered corners.

#### Installation
{:.color-primary}

One of the main benefits of Norstone Basalt 3D is the ease with which they can be installed. The panel system provides for rapid installation over prepared cementitious surfaces, such as cement board, brick / block, or a traditional lathe and scratch coat using a polymer modified tile thinset. Basalt 3D is ideally cut on a tile wet saw and are highly calibrated, allowing the installer to interlock one panel into its neighboring panels, thus creating the highly desirable dry stack look and eliminating the need to grout or point mortar between individual pieces or units.  

Basalt is a porous natural stone and should be sealed in both interior and exterior applications to minimize and prevent any staining of the product. Water based, penetrating sealers should be used and applied per manufacturer's instructions. Variants of sealers can tested and used to achieve differing effects and sheens.  

The beauty of the Basalt 3D lies in its simplicity, and whether part of a large scale commercial application, or a small residential project, all levels of installers will find the Basalt 3D quick and easy to install and a pleasure to work with.

#### Natural Stone Sealer
{:.color-primary}

Basalt 3D should be sealed with water based penetrating natural stone sealer. Different sealers can be applied depending on the characteristics of the application or to achieve a desired look or finish. Always test sealers on a sample piece, off cut, or in an inconspicuous place prior to installing over the entire application.
