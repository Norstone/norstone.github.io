The countdown to Memorial Day and the unofficial start to summer is in full swing, and if you're like many of us, that long three day weekend is best spent having fun and enjoying a nice break, not doing house projects. It's never been easier to tackle a DIY Stone Wall project than it is now using any of Norstone's natural stone panel system products. If you've got a wall, a weekend, a little tiling experience (or a willingness to learn), and the need to impress your significant other, this project is for you!

<h2> What are DIY Stone Walls?</h2>

Undertaking a DIY stone wall project proves surprisingly accessible for homeowners seeking to elevate their space. With user-friendly stone veneer panel systems, the process becomes a straightforward endeavor, allowing individuals to effortlessly enhance an ordinary wall the timeless look of natural stone. These veneer panel systems are only a few inches deep, making them significantly lighter and easier to use than other heavy stones. User friendly products, such as the aforementioned stone panels, cement board for the substrate, and polymer modified tile thinset for the setting materials, empowers homeowners to achieve a beautiful and personalized project with confidence.  Simply put DIY stone walling has never been easier!

<h2> What Types of Products Make Great DIY Stone Walls?</h2>

Let's first break down the product itself. Norstone makes [natural stone panel system products](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/) in a number of different styles, ranging from the traditional split face ledge stone look of the Standard Rock Panels to the modern smooth finishes of the Aksent 3D Panels and Planc Large Format Tiles. The basis of all the panel systems is that the small individual stones that make up the panels come epoxied together in panels. The panels are manufactured with a high degree of calibration ensuring they fit together snug and without gapping on your wall.

These well thought out and designed panel systems and large format tile sets transform the installation process into essentially the same type of installation and skill level required as setting wall tile. These products streamline the otherwise intricate task of hand-setting loose stones, eliminating the need for meticulous alignment and precise placement. The straightforward application of a panel system or large format tile set significantly reduces the time and effort required, making it an accessible option for homeowners seeking a hassle-free yet visually striking upgrade to their walls.

If you have experience laying loose stone, these products can also be installed in a DIY stone walling project. Loose natural stone veneer opens you up to lots of different types of stone to consider as well as being able to use larger stones that might not fit neatly into a panel system product. Flat stones are a must to create a good bond with the wall and knowledge of how loose stone is sold, often by weight and sometimes by cubic feet volume, is critical knowledge to have if you plan to install loose natural stone veneer on a DIY stone wall project.

<h2> Where can DIY Stone Walls be Installed?</h2>

A DIY Stone Wall can be created in lots of different applications – ranging from interior or exterior feature walls, fireplaces, back splashes, shower walls, landscape and retaining walls, just to name a few. You can learn all the details about installing Norstone products on our [stacked stone installation page](https://www.norstoneusa.com/how-to-install-stacked-stone/). The most important starting point is to make sure your wall is a suitable substrate for a DIY Stone Wall. Any cementious substrate will do – normally cement board for most interior applications, as well as brick, block, pre-fab concrete, and even traditional lathe + scratch coat for all other applications.

<h2> What are the Basics of Installing DIY Stone Walls?</h2>

When it comes time to actually installing the tile, the DIY installer is going to use a [polymer modified tile thinset](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-different-types-of-thinset-and-what-s-the-best-thinset-for-stacked-stone-installations/) to adhere the stone panels to the wall, back buttering each panel and using a 1/2” square notch trowel for the thinset against the wall. All of panel system products cut easily on tile wet saw, which you can rent from an equipment rental place, or even pick up an inexpensive one at a discount hardware and tool shop. Working from the bottom up, checking and staying level is important so the panels continue to fit nice and tight as your work your way up the wall.

An often overlooked stepped in a DIY Stone Wall installation is the application of a [waterproofing / crack isolation membrane](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/waterproofing-membranes-for-stacked-stone/) that goes between the cementious substrate and the thinset that is used to adhere the stone panels to the wall. This membrane is important for any exterior project, especially those in freeze / thaw climates, as well as any interior application where water is routinely expected to be on the stone like a shower feature wall. A waterproofing / crack isolation membrane sounds intimidating, but in reality it's a product that goes on like a very thick paint, sets up in a couple hours, and most of the time even changes colors to let you know it's ready to be installed over.
