When Spring is in the air it means convention season is in full swing for the stacked stone industry. Norstone will be at two industry conventions during the month of April, the United Buyers Group Buyers University show in Anaheim, CA and Coverings in Orlando, FL. If you are attending either of these conventions and are either already familiar with Norstone or want to learn more in person, please stop by our booth at Buyers University or send us an email and we'll meet up with you at Coverings.

If you haven't heard of or been to either of these conventions before, here's a quick rundown of what makes each a great show.

The Buyers University show is the annual meeting for the United Buyers Group, which is a collective of independent fireplace dealers from across North America and Canada. The United Buyers Group, or UBG, is a closed group and potential new members are heavily vetted to make sure the businesses they represent are professionally run, generally have years of experience in the fireplace and hearth industry, and have a strong reputation in their local market. Norstone was lucky enough to be approached by the UBG in 2017 to become a supplier to their members. [Fireplaces](https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/fireplace/) have always been the most popular type of project that our stone gets used on, so it was a natural fit to supply Norstone products to the UBG. Along with other well known companies in the fireplace, grill, and accessories market, we will be displaying all of our products at the Buyers University show for all the UBG members to see.

One of the really interesting things about Buyers University is that, as the name implies, it's a buying show. The UBG members come ready to see new products and place orders on the spot. We're really looking forward to this years Buyers University show where we'll be showcasing the [complete lineup of Norstone products](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/) in addition to a private label brand we created for the UBG in 2018 and are excited for another successful show April 17-18.

While Buyers University is a highly specialized show that focuses specifically on fireplace dealers, [Coverings](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/everything-tile-stone-at-coverings-in-orlando/) is probably the most important show of the year for the tile and stone industry as a whole. Coverings has a unique set up in that the manufacturers represented are grouped together by country, giving a unique international flair to the experience as you walk the convention floor. We look forward to Coverings every year and use it as an opportunity to stay on top of the latest trends in terms of product and colors and connect with other suppliers from around the world, all in one place. There's also an amazing program of keynote speakers and classroom sessions that provide some of the greatest information and insight about trends and [issues facing the stone and tile industry](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-chinese-tariffs-impact-the-stacked-stone-industry/) that you just won't find anywhere else.

This year, the show returns to Orlando, FL April 9-12. Norstone will not be exhibiting at the show this year because of the tight turn around with Buyers University, but we will have a lot of our team in town, walking the show, and meeting with clients throughout the week. If you are going to be in town, please shoot us an email and we'll schedule a time to meet up before, during, or after the show.

We look forward to seeing our existing clients and customers as well as meeting new ones at this Spring's slate of conventions. If you'll be at one, both, or either of these conventions in April â€“ safe travels, come say hi to your friends at Norstone, and watch out for the long security lines at the Orlando airport (author speaking from experience) !
