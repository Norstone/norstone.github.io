2018 has been one heck of a year for the team here at Norstone's New Dimensions in Natural Stone blog.  With the calendar resetting to January in a few short days, we wanted to take a quick moment to review some of the highlights from a truly incredible year.  With no further delay!

**New Products**

This past year saw the culmination of a lot of work by our overseas R&D teams based in Australia and Vietnam come to fruition in the form of new products we successfully brought to market.  [Planc large format tile](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/) has been tremendously successful and is pushing the limits of not just what people think or as wall veneer, but also the types of products that the market and many of our legacy customers associate Norstone with.  The super [smooth modern stone look](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-trends-when-it-comes-to-stone-smooth-is-in/) of the Planc series is considerably different than the traditional stacked stone panel systems Norstone has been known for over the past decade plus and has helped reignite old customers and inspire new ones.

Our [Slim Line budget stacked stone panel](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-slim-line-budget-stone-veneer/) system also officially launched in 2019, and while not as trend setting as the Planc, has given all of our customers the ability to compete with far inferior products that are becoming more and more prevalent in the market.  Slim Line, which is a thinner version of our Standard Series Rock Panel, has so much to offer, including the Norstone craftsmanship and design, outside corner units and natural end pieces, as well as a being eligible for an extended system warranty via Laticrete, that it's a no brainer to use Slim Line instead of a bargain basement stone veneer panel from a big box store.

**New and Re Kindled Relationships**

One of the best parts about working with a product where we supply the entire vertical, from a top level distributor / re-seller to sometimes working direct with a homeowner client is making new relationships on practically a daily basis.  One of the things we're most grateful for in 2018 was new relationships that we formed and a few old ones that we re-kindled.  Becoming vendor partners in the United Buyers Group in the early Spring and attending their Buyers University in Texas this April where we instantly were able to show our product to hundreds of top fireplace showrooms from across the country was an amazing experience.  And through the launch of our new products and display systems, we got a chance to get back out in front of many of our legacy wholesale customers and re-invigorate them on what Norstone looks like in 2018 and beyond – we're not just stacked stone anymore!

**Great Content on the New Dimensions in Natural Stone Blog**

One of the things we're really proud about is that come January 2019, this blog, [New Dimensions in Natural Stone](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/), will be two years old and counting.  We're excited to be pumping out 50+ posts each year of all sorts of natural stone related content.  From our “How To” Series, to technical / installation related posts, to industry news, as well as our bi weekly project profiles, we hope you find what we're doing here week in and week out useful and interesting.  We get almost all the inspiration for our weekly articles from customers questions to our sales and technical staff, but if there's ever anything that you would like to see covered don't be shy and email us at [sales@norstoneusa.com](mailto:sales@norstoneusa.com).

Thanks for taking a quick trip down memory lane with us today.  We hope 2018 was a great year for you, and we look forward to sharing with you weekly the comings and goings of Norstone and our team, and all the amazing things we have planned for 2019!
