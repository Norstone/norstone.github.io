Our [White Stacked Stone Rock Panels](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/white/), available in both our Standard Series and XL Series, is a color that we've always hung our hat on since it's a truly unique stone in the market. Most white stacked stone panels you'll find on the market either have a ton of sparkles or have a semi transparent top layer that tends to look a little dull and grey and doesn't give the product a nice white color pop. Owing to our exclusive stone sourcing supply chain, we've been sourcing and building our White Rock Panels from the same set of quarries for well over a decade and create a beautiful product that has just the right amount of understated sparkle to catch your attention without going overboard and, most importantly, a beautiful pure white color that might make you mistake this [natural stone for  a man made product](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/real-stone-vs-faux-norstone-industry-series/).

This summer we have worked with so many customers that are seeking out the White product, so much so that all of our White Rock Panels were already sold and ready to ship out before one of our resupply containers arrived in Mid August. White is a classic color in design that is never really going to go out of style, but no doubt is seeing a resurgence as architects, designers, and homeowners alike all seek out a neutral color to replace the beige tones of the early 2000s and the grey explosion of the last 5 years or so. With a great texture and clean lines geometric lines, the white rock panels are a perfect canvas to work color pops off of using other finishes, furniture, and accessories.

This week's featured project is a fireplace in the main common area of a transitional styled home. There's a ton of great stuff going on with this fireplace so let's have a look at what makes this job special.

The color pallete of the space what really jumps out at us first. The pure white of the cabinets, floating shelves, and trim work stand out against the grey tones of the walls and floors. The stone needed to be just as white to not detract from the contrast already being created between white and grey, which is where our White Rock Panels come in. A lot of white stone on the market can end up having a significant amount of grey “marbling” too it. The homeowner made a wise choice to go with our white stacked stone panel to get that nice bright natural stone white that is hard to find on the market.

The linear design is something you might not notice right away, but definitely speaks to your eyes. Each of the White Rock Panels have stones that are 1.5 inches tall and will vary in length between about 4 and 8 inches. When used in the typical horizontal orientation this creates a very linear look to the fireplace, which is accented in a number of ways through the rest of this space. The long skinny fireplace, the floating shelves, and the low slung [modern style furniture pairs with the stone](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/pairing-furniture-with-natural-stone-veneer/) and its long horizontal style. Even the fan, with its sharp angular blades, keeps those angles nice, tight, and devoid of any curves.

This pulled back view of the space further shows the modern design scheme and color pallete as it spills out from the fireplace. The color combination of the blues / teals to go along with the white and grey base tones of this space is an underrated and underused look which gives a nice contrast but still has a pretty mellow vibe.

If you're looking at stone for a project, whether its a fireplace, feature wall, backsplash, or pool, don't think of white as plain or boring. White is the perfect classic color that will give you long term style and the ability to change things around it while still looking new with every refresh.
