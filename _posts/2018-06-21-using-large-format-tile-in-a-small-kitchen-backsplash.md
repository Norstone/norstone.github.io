<h2>When did Large Tile Backsplashes Become Popular</h2>

When most people think of large format tile the first thing that comes to mind is flooring.  In fact, throughout the 1980s, 90s, and early 2000s one of the biggest changes in the tile industry was tile sizes getting larger and larger.  12X12s gave way to 18x18s, 24x24s, 36x36s and so on.  Innovative companies are keeping the quest for bigger being better alive and well with precision manufactured porcelain products that can be sized up to 1 meter x 3 meters while only being a few millimeters thick, creating a covering that is tile but behaves almost like a skin.

The tile industry has now embraced shape and patterns as equal cornerstones of good design and we're seeing rectangles and planks as well as patterns that range from traditional herringbone and parquets to intricate multi size and shape tile patterns.

<h2>PLANC: Norstone's Large Format Tile Backsplash Offering</h2>

Something we're very proud of is our recently released [PLANC large format wall tile collection](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/).  As floor tile was getting bigger, wall tile was staying relatively small, with mosaics dominating the design trends on areas like kitchen backsplashes.  We set out to prove that [large format tiles](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/planc-new-dimension-norstone/) have a place in any wall tile project, and this cozy corner kitchen backsplash is a perfect example of how a large format tile can work nicely in a small space.

<h2>Platinum Planc Kitchen Backsplash Project</h2>

From a scaling standpoint, each of the Plancs on this backsplash are 31.5” long, and come in three heights (5.5”, 3.1”, and 2.4”).  Like most [current kitchen backsplashes](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/backsplash-tile-designs-norstone-industy-series/), this one has about 18” of wall space between the top of the countertop and bottom of the upper cabinet, which a you can see in the head on photo of the sink, allows for about six courses of the Planc stone to be set.  The courses in this installation were set in a random staggered pattern, creating a pattern that complements the different heights and creates a lot of visual interest in this small space.

From a color standpoint, the grey color pallete of the Platinum is extremely appealing to modern design.  This kitchen, with its white marble counter tops and white cabinets creates a great contrasting look with the neutral grey tones.  But what makes this product really appealing is the amazing surface characteristics that make it unmistakable that this is a natural stone.  The [Lava Stone](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/lava-stone-rocks/) that this product is made from ranges from a smooth saw cut finish with tight graining to consistently honeycombed appearance with lots of surface divots.  What we actually love the most though is the occasional vein of honeycombing that shows up every now and then giving the product a natural stone look that just can't be beat.  An installer with a keen eye, like the team that worked on this project, can use these veins to their advantage by lining up the veins from one course of wall tile to the next for a true handcrafted look.

One last thing we love about this project is the great use of natural light in the space.  The open concept of the space brings in natural light from every angle, but especially the prominent window in the corner.  Natural light brings out the best in everything in the space, color, texture, and scale wise, making sure the large Planc tiles on the backsplash don't feel too dark and big for the space.

<h2>Natural Stone vs Other Mediums in Wall Tile</h2>

One of the biggest advantages that products like Norstone Planc Large Format wall tile have is being made of natural stone. Larger Tiles, especially ceramic tile or porcelain have to be very well made to avoid repeat patterning which is something mother nature ensures will not happen with a natural stone wall tile, no matter how large the field tile. Natural stone wall tile, since it is cut from larger blocks, can also be very highly calibrated since and basically as precise as the machinery used to cut it, while other wall tile products, porcelain for example, can experience “bowing” of the tile, where the middle of a large tile is bowed up compared to the ends based on how the tile is manufactured.

<h2>Other Considerations for Large Format Tile</h2>

When talking about wall tile and specifically large format tile, a couple of things to consider is the application and use requirements and relative sizes of other like material in the design. From an application and use standpoint, you always want to consider where the wall tile is going to be used and what conditions that wall tile is going to be subjected to. Bathroom tiles for a high end restaurant bathroom have a higher need for durability and low maintenance than a bathroom or shower tiles in a private home. Ceramic Tile, while shortchanging the space of the authenticity of a natural stone product might be a better wall tile option for a public use space whereas a product like Norstone Planc large format tile could work great for the wall tile in a private master bath.
Considering the relative sizes of other similar products in the overall design of a space is another important consideration for using large format tile. If you are designing a feature wall and the only other wall tile in that space is a 3”x6” subway tile, a large format tile like Norstone Planc might clash from a scale standpoint  and smaller mosaic tiles, such as Norstone Lynia interlocking wall tile might be something to consider.

<h2>Can Tile Sizes be Too Big?</h2>

When is big too big is a great question when it comes to wall tile and specifically large format tile. The size of a wall tile can indeed be a matter of preference and suitability for a particular space. In some cases, an oversized wall tile may overwhelm a small room, making it appear cramped and unbalanced. Conversely, in larger areas, such as open-concept living spaces or expansive bathrooms, a large wall tile can create a seamless and visually appealing appearance. The key is to strike a balance by selecting wall tile sizes that harmonize with the room's dimensions and layout to achieve a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing design.
