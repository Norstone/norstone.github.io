An outdoor kitchen is a great addition to any home, even in northern climates where the winter season can limit year round use.  Recent data suggests that [outdoor kitchens and living spaces](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/natural-stone-patios-designing-norstone-series/) can net anywhere between a 70 to 200% return on investment (ROI) depending on the location and materials used, with the higher ROIs seen in the areas of the country where the space can be used year round.  Stacked stone has been a popular choice for outdoor kitchens ever since they became popular in the late 90s and early 2000s, primarily used on the vertical surfaces of the cabinets, backsplashes, and vent hoods.

This week's project is a great example of a larger outdoor kitchen, complete with a large grill, small refrigerator, and plenty of counter space to meal prep and entertain with.  Let's take a closer look at this project and explain why it stands out to us.

One of the first things we see about this project that we really liked is the way this product used our [Ochre XL stone veneer panels](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/ochre/) as a true accent color of the space.  With the stone patio, furniture cushions and counter top all having a very neutral color range, the nice rust color accents of the stone veneer really pop and catch the eye, while the brown and grey base tones of the Ochre color work nicely with the grey colors of the house and fence.

Speaking of color, the stainless steel used on the grill, the refrigerator, and the cabinets not only is a great material for ease of use and long term durability, but also pairs well with the stone veneer.  Our Rock Panels have a very clean line look to their design with consistent horizontal and vertical lines that lends itself to a [modern inspired stone aesthetic](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/glass-steel-stone-for-modern-homes/) which pairs well with a material like stainless steel.  Stainless also offers top notch durability for outdoor kitchen components ensuring you spend your weekends enjoying the space and not maintaining it.

One of the really cool features of this outdoor kitchen is the counter top itself.  The natural edge of this concrete counter top matches up nicely with the split face of the stone.  A more traditional edge profile such as a bull nose or eased edge wouldn't look nearly as good as this natural edge does in the space.  We also really like the relatively large thickness of this counter top, which fits in just perfectly with an outdoor space where things are always just a little big bigger and gives a nice bold look to the outdoor kitchen.

One last thing that catches our eye on the stone veneer part of this outdoor kitchen is the nice use of our finger jointed outside corner units.  We take a lot of pride in our corner units being the [best looking corner units on the market](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/miter-cut-vs-corner-unit/).  Instead of a more simple dovetail configuration which other stone veneer manufacturers employ, our finger joint corner systems pairs approximately 6 to 7 fingers for every 6 inches of vertical corner making for the most realistic corner configuration on the market.  Every piece of stone that faces out on these corner units is the natural cleft adding to the believability of the corner condition.

Whether you're looking for an outdoor kitchen complete with grill, fridge, and prep sink, or even if your space dictates that a grilling island is all that can fit, stacked stone is a great option for a classic look that will last a lifetime if built correctly.
