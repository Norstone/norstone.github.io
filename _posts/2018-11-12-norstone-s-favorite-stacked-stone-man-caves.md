Football season is about half way over and you're still looking at your basement, garage, den, or spare bedroom and regretting that you haven't started your man cave project sooner – don't fret!  There's still plenty of time to put together an awesome space that'll have you relaxing and your wife or significant other wondering what she agreed to!  For those of you that appreciate great looking spaces, consider stacked stone or other [modern natural stone wall veneers](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/) as an excellent choice for a feature wall in the space.

Many of our previous clients have worked on man cave projects in the past, and today we wanted to share with you a few of our favorites, including one or two that admittedly might have taken the “man design” a bit too far!

This first project was part of a complete basement remodel in the greater Philadelphia area that was done many years ago.  No man cave is complete without a bar, and this one looks like a great place to belly up to.  Our Ochre Stacked Stone Rock Panels line the short bar back splash, as well as cover the adjoining wall surrounding the back lit bottle built in shelves.  Beyond the bar, this entire basement is a really special space complete with a beautiful modern fireplace, a [wall mounted large screen tv](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-install-a-flat-screen-tv-on-a-stacked-stone-wall/), and lots of music memorabilia displayed to highlight the interests of the owner.  The one thing that really stands out about this space to us is that it's done incredibly classy.

This next project isn't actually in anyone's personal home, but for anyone that is drawn to the allure of table games, this would be high on their wish list.  This high roller's private room has everything a man cave needs – big tvs, card tables with comfortable seating for you and your closest dozen friends, [beautiful gas fireplaces](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/top-5-stone-fireplaces-2017/), and to top it off a mounted long horn cow at the figurative, and literal, center of the room.  Our Charcoal Rock Panels are done in an elegant way such that their modern linear style complement the long and thin gas fireplaces and serve as a perfect backdrop of the two large screen tvs.

Something not too many people know about when it comes to a stacked stone wall is that it also is a great noise reducer.  The thickness and density of natural stone obviously help with sound suppression from one room to the next, while the variable texture of a product like ledgestone does an excellent job of bouncing sounds waves in multiple directions, helping to diffuse sound within the room.  This makes stacked stone a great pick nor just for [award winning concert halls](https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/project/rockport/), but for keeping the sound of a man cave in the man cave.

Our last project is a tongue in cheek example of what can go wrong with a man cave.  We absolutely love the stone on this project, especially the use of our outside corner units on both the hearth and main face of the fireplace.  But, the sheer number of mounted and stuffed fish and other animals in this space can be a bit overwhelming!  We also really like the large wood burning fireplace in this space – not something that you see too often anymore, but I think most would agree that having to start your own fire is certainly a manly thing to do.

Thanks for taking a quick look at a couple of our favorite man cave projects featuring some of our stacked stone products.
