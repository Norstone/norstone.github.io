excerpt: In this week's blog we're featuring an older project where the basement was
  converted into one of the most amazing wine cellars using our Ochre Stacked Stone
  Rock Panels throughout the space.  Let's pop a cork and immerse ourselves in the
  beauty of this installation.

The project we're featuring in this week's blog is actually probably close to 10 years old, and while we haven't shown it off too often recently, it was a great trip down memory lane to see how amazing this wine cellar turned out. Our [Ochre Stacked Stone Rock Panels](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/ochre/) are featured prominently on almost all the walls throughout the space and most impressively as part of the entryway featuring a beautiful spiral staircase. Come take a quick look around this project with us and see what makes this stacked stone installation so special.

The logical place to start on a tour of this wine cellar is at the entryway. We've always loved this door because of how well the color works with the Ochre Blend Stacked Stone Rock Panels that flank the sides and top. Our Ochre Blend Stacked Stone Rock Panels are a carefully curated blend of earth tones, comprised mainly of browns and greys with rust colored accents. The orange door frame and rustic metal door really fit perfectly into the color scheme of the stone. While we really love this door, what's behind it is even more impressive!

What's behind the door is this amazing spiral staircase that leads from the outside entrance of this wine cellar down below ground to the cellar itself. The metalwork of the spiral staircase has a beautiful coppery rust color which is a beautiful complement to the [color pallete of the Ochre Stacked Stone](https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels/ochre/) panels that cover the stairwell itself.

Stepping into the wine cellar itself you start to get a feel for the space and the building materials used, chief among them the Ochre Stacked Stone Rock Panels which are prominently featured on the central columns as well as almost any wall space that isn't taken up with wine racking or shelving. The dark natural wood ceiling along with the wood veneer over the beams matches the wine racking and keeps with the very earth tone color scheme. A light neutral colored tile keeps the space from getting too dark, especially important considering it is underground and has relatively low ceilings.

The columns itself are a throw back to the days before Norstone made interlocking finger joint outside corner units. The stacked stone on these columns has been expertly [miter cut](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/miter-cut-vs-corner-unit/) and laid by the installer to form tight and sharp outside corners. Rustic built in shelves along with a small counter to set bottles on make this column look far more appealing than the standard metal basement support and super functional too.

A wine cellar by its very nature isn't going to have a lot of natural light, and this project is no exception, which makes the [lighting an important element of the stacked stone installation](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/). The recessed spot lights along this back wall show off the magnum bottles proudly displayed in the built in shelves and make the stacked stone look gorgeous as well. Lighting is an overlooked, but important part of almost any project, especially a stacked stone project as the right lighting with the right placement can really bring out the beauty in any stacked stone wall.
