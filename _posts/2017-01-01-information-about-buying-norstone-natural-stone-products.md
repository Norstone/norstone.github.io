## Why Norstone® Natural Stone Products?

1. Our Natural Stone Collections are 100% natural stone and is designed to provide you with a high end, world class result while reducing your onsite installation costs.
2. Natural stone eliminates any worry about the problems inherent to faux stone including fading or cracking with age.
3. Our panel systems are a lightweight, thin stone veneer which lessens support requirements.  This allows the product to be installed on existing structures without weight issues.
4. Versatile, easy to use - a DIY delight
5. Our Panel Systems stand exactly 6" tall and spans 24" in width.  These panels allow you to side-step the painstaking labor of installing normal stone veneers 1 piece at a time. Simply dry-stack and stagger your panels as you lay them and that's it.  No grouting required; once they're on the wall, you're done. Simpler than laying even tile.

I recommend taking look at our [installation guide page](http://www.norstoneusa.com/how-to-install-stacked-stone) to review the installation in more detail.  There are a number of detailed downloads there for you.

If you would like to see more finished project photos of our Natural Stone Products, please visit our [Products Gallery](http://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels). There you will find many Norstone® projects, some of which might emulate or have similar qualities to the project you're working on.
