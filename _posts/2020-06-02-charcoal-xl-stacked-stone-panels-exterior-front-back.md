One of the cool things about [exterior stacked stone projects](https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/exteriors/) is that the possibilities really are endless when it comes to where a product like a stacked stone panel can be used. Entryways, wainscoats, entire facades, privacy walls, and mailboxes are some of the ways a stacked stone panel is often used on the front facing elevation of a home. When you make your way around to the back stacked stone panels can often be found on pools, fire pits, outdoor fireplaces, retaining walls, and water features. This week's featured project is out of Southwest Florida and features our Charcoal XL Series Stacked Stone Panels used both on the front entryway as well as in an outdoor fireplace and numerous columns in the back patio. We love how they incorporated the stone into all of these places and the results speak for themselves. Let's take a quick look around this amazing home!

The front entryway of this home showcases the [Charcoal XL Series Stacked Stone Panels](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/charcoal/) on an adjacent feature wall visible from the street and prominent to the front porch itself. The Charcoal color is works nicely with the darker hues of the home and front door as well as pops out nicely against the white trim. Norstone's industry leading finger jointed outside corner system is perfect for this application as it creates a nice smooth outside corner that looks great and is more functional than miter cut outside corner in this heavily trafficked area.

Moving around to the rear of this beautiful home you're greeted with an absolutely stunning patio featuring a floor to ceiling stacked stone fireplace. When you hear about [“outdoor living”](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stacked-stone-for-outdoor-living/) on your favorite HGTV show, this is what they're talking about! A curved seating arrangement invites friends and family to engage in conversation while also staging a perfect place to enjoy the beautiful gas burning fireplace or catch a game or evening movie on the wall mounted television. We especially like the architectural cut outs flanking the firebox which adds a ton of character and functionality to the wall. While this particular fireplace was a new build out, one of the most appealing reasons to use stacked stone panels for a fireplace project is that since they are thin and lightweight they can often be simple adhered directly over the existing substrate, transforming an old dated fireplace into a stunning centerpiece with a couple hours work.

The icing on the cake of this project is the columns that flank the rear of the house and surround the pool. The stone design ties directly into the outdoor fireplace and patio making this home's entire outdoor space, from the fireplace, to the outdoor kitchen and bar, to the pool a cohesive design. We really like how the top trim piece on these columns conceals LED strip lighting to accentuate the columns during the night time hours. [Columns of stone](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stone-veneer-columns-norstone-classroom-series/) evoke a tremendously strong presence that is hard to beat in terms of durability and the thin profile of Norstone stacked stone panels allow for the columns to be wrapped with minimal expansion of the column footprint but with the maximum effect that stacked stone can provide.

Thanks for taking a look around this beautiful residential exterior project with us. Charcoal XL is a great product in this application to match the darker color scheme, but stone of varying colors and finishes can also be used outside to gain the same benefits of a timelessly elegant product with unmatched durability.
