Open concept floor plans with massive two story great rooms are one of our favorite residential designs. The openness of the space can certainly be a challenge, but also an opportunity that you don't often get in residential interior design to make a really big splash. In this week's project profile we're diving into this amazing two story fireplace that used our [White Standard Series Rock Panels](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/white/) as the floor to ceiling veneer selection.

<h2> Two Story Stone Fireplace</h2>

The first thing about this project that needs to be understood and appreciated is the scale. This photo, taken from an upper hallway down into the room shows what kind of heights this stacked stone fireplace reaches. The fireplace insert and the flanking cabinets look tiny from way up here and we're even staring down at the fan. While greatly increasing the complexity of the project, we do think an installation looks better when it goes all the way up to the ceiling. In the instance of crown molding like we see on this project, miter cutting the molding to a short return against the wall right against the stone would have looked great.

Taken separately, a stacked stone fireplace is one of the most beautiful veneer options a fireplace can have, while a two story fireplace is awe inspiring by the scale of the installation itself. Combining these two like we see in this project results in a truly breathtaking installation that easily asserts itself as the focal point of the space.

<h2>Challenges of a Two Story Floor to Ceiling Fireplace</h2>

Some practical considerations for installing stone veneer in a tall application like this are that scaffolding would have needed to be erected in the room during the install, and when working on scaffolding, the installation becomes either a two or three man project. To keep the [thinset for the stone veneer](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-different-types-of-thinset-and-what-s-the-best-thinset-for-stacked-stone-installations/) within its workable “pot life”, normally the tile setter stays on the scaffolding and has help from one or more helpers to make the appropriate cuts, haul up new boxes of panels to be set, and mix up new batches of thinset when needed. The weight of the stone is also an important consideration, which is what makes a thin stone veneer product ideal for a tall installation like this. Traditional full bed masonry veneer stone, generally 4”+ in thickness, would require significant increases in the engineering of the wall to support the weight. Thin stone veneers, especially those that weigh less than 15 lbs per sq ft and can be installed using adhesives, are a great alternative traditional masonry in applications like this.

While a space like this one, with a huge vaulted ceiling and a floor to ceiling fireplace does pose some installation challenges, the look that is achieved is certainly spectacular. In particular the decision to use Norstone White Rock Panels, which are a highly textured stacked stone veneer product in an absolutely stunning bright, clean white color range instead of something boring like a plain brick fireplace veneer levels up this installation and the entire space from something fairly average to a magazine worthy project.

<h2>Two Story Fireplace: Details at Ground Level</h2>

Coming down to ground level, the details of the fireplace start to come together. We're big fans of the black fireplace insert, not just because the color as it creates a great contrast with the white stacked stone, but also the long linear design of the insert which complements the width of the fireplace feature itself and also the horizontal design of the rock panels themselves. Long linear inserts like this one are extremely popular in modern fireplace design and can be both beautiful in the shape and how the flame presents as well as extremely efficient as a heat source for the room. Wiring has been run for a yet to be [installed television over the stacked stone](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-install-a-flat-screen-tv-on-a-stacked-stone-wall/), and the built in cabinets give the space a well thought out look that is also very practical in a room like this.

<h2>Two Story Stone Fireplace as Part of an Overall Design Scheme</h2>

In this pulled back view of the fireplace, what really catches our eye is the exceptional job the homeowners did with the color pallete of the space. Starting with the white stacked stone panels as the centerpiece, the walls and couches all flow nicely into a very neutral range of whites and creams. White walls or grey walls would either wash out the white color of the stone or neutralize the pop the white stone provides. While grey walls and the overall grey + beige = greige color tone has been so popular in recent years, we do feel like the white color range of the White Rock Panel stone veneer product looks much better against neutral earth tones like the beiges and tans on this project than many of the grey walls we see in today's designs. These neutral base tones let the accent colors of the chair, rug, pillows and throw really stand out. And lastly, the sofa table and lamp, perhaps hidden in plain sight, add a slightly darker neutral tone to the space which creates layers and depth that all work together very nicely in the finished product.

Not everyone is going to have a two story family room with a fireplace where a dramatic stone veneer installation like this could be done, but don't be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to ideas that might be similar but achievable given a unique space. An outdoor fireplace, which are often easier to install in a retrofit manner, can sometimes be a great option to go tall with. Don't overlook any plain white walls either, as there are lots of super thin electric fireplace inserts that can be hung on the wall like a TV and then have stone veneer installed around them to create similar looks.

Bravo to the homeowners for taking on a bold challenge like a floor to ceiling fireplace. Our Rock Panel product is a great choice for a project like this since it's light weight, easy to use, and can be installed over a variety of different common substrates used for fireplaces. Whether you have a short, tall, or no fireplace at all – [Norstone Rock Panels and Stone Veneer](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/) products are worth considering for your next wall covering project.
