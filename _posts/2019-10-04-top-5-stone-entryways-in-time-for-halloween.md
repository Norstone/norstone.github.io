The entryway of a home is a lot of things. From a practical standpoint, its the gateway between the outside public world and your inner private life. From a design standpoint, it's often the centerpiece of the overall design of at least the front facade of the building and offers lots of different opportunities to personalize the space to how you want to feel when moving from the public to the private side of life. Subtle features like lighting and door / handle fixtures are small areas of distinction, while the door itself and the materials used to surround it make a bigger impact. In the realm of design choices, few materials command attention and admiration quite like a stone exterior. Whether you're striving for timeless elegance or a rustic charm, a stone exterior emerges as the unsung hero, capable of transforming a mere entrance into a grand gateway. In this blog, we'll embark on a journey through some of our favorite stone entryway projects and see why a stone exterior stands out as the quintessential choice for enhancing the beauty, resilience, and overall allure of your home's entryway. So, buckle up as we delve into how stone becomes not just a product but a defining element in creating a welcoming and lasting first impression.

<h2> What is a Stone Entryway?</h2>

Before we get started looking at our favorite stone entryway projects let's first understand what a stone entryway is. A stone entryway is really open to interpretation, but what we generally view them as are projects where stone is used around the main entryway of a home.  Natural stone doesn't have to be the only material used, in fact we'll see in our top 5 projects that a stone exterior pairs well with lots of other materials, especially glass, metal, and wood.  We also broadened the entryway concept to include not just the area immediately surrounding the front door, but also including the full entryway and path from the street or driveway to the door, as that all becomes part of the experience of the broader entrance to the home.  And while we're focusing on residential stone exterior projects in today's list, for all the business owners out there, don't be afraid to make the leap and leverage some of these same design concepts to make an inviting and statement producing entryway for your business. Among many benefits, a stone exterior is incredibly durable, which is often high up on the priority list for a business or commercial project. So without further delay, here are Norstone's Top 5 Stone Entryway Projects!

<h2> Coastal Contemporary Stone Entryway</h2>

**#5** - This contemporary home on the west coast of Florida has an awesome light and airy color scheme. The entryway on this house is clad in our [Ivory Rock Panels](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/ivory/), which also get used on various stone exterior accents on the front of this home. Stone columns as well as stone walls leading right up to the door itself give this home a really sophisticated look. The contrast between the texture of the stone exterior and the smooth stucco and clean lines of the metal roof and dark wood accents make this a stunning entryway.

<h2> Clean Lined Modern Stone Entryway</h2>

**#4** – This beautiful entryway stands out because it looks amazing with a relatively simple design. The absolutely gorgeous twin dark wood doors accent the brown, grey and rustic color range of the Ochre [Slimline Rock Panels](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-slim-line-budget-stone-veneer/) that are flanking the entryway on both sides and above. The glass and dark metal framework / trim gives the entryway a distinctly modern vibe. The white walls flanking the sides of the entryway allow the entryway to take center stage and the huge glass panes surrounding the door and cool light fixtures make for a very trendy foyer photo for Instagram.

<h2> Classic Column Entryway with Stone Accents</h2>

**#3** – We like this next entryway because its a lot more than just the front door. Starting at the sidewalk, this house invites people to walk up with a terraced set of steps flanked by [stone veneer columns](https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stone-veneer-columns-norstone-classroom-series/) and a low retaining wall. The columns, retaining wall and step risers are all clad in our Ochre XL Series Rock Panels. The more immediate entryway near the front door has a more classic vibe with traditional columns, so the stone accents that are further out along the path to the street feel inherently more organic and natural as a result of the spacing and contrast.

<h2> Linear Stone Entryway</h2>

**#2** – This super modern home in California features our [Platinum Planc large format tiles](https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/platinum/) surrounding the medium wood door as well as cladding the wall that leads from the front of the house to the entryway. The uniquely hinged solid wood door isn’t something you see every day, and kudos to the design teams on this project for using this type of hinge which better positions the door straddled across the threshold and doesn't crowd out the small area immediately outside the door. We also really like the medium wood color tones of the door and trim. This lighter medium wood color is bright and inviting and subtly sets the tone for the entryway. Fingers

<h2> Industrial Chic Stone Entryway</h2>

**#1** – The top entryway on our list of stone entryways for Halloween is this modern duplex in Colorado. When it comes to Halloween and trick or treating, it's hard to beat the 2 for 1 candy grab of a duplex. This duplex certainly isn't what most would consider traditional with large amounts of our [Ochre Stacked Stone Rock Panels](https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels/ochre/) clad across the front facade along with large metal accents and white walls of stucco throughout.  We love the industrial chic vibe the renovation professionals created when working on this project through the use of metal accents, including the balcony railings and cantilevered rain cover as well as the abundant natural stone on this project, not just by the entryway, but all over the hardscape as well.    

We hope you enjoyed our list of the top 5 stone entryways.
