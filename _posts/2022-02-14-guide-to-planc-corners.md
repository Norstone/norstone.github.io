<b>How should I plan out my Corners for a PLANC Installation?</b>

Perhaps one of the most common questions we receive from clients is: How do I handle corners for PLANC™?

It’s worth noting, before we begin, that our PLANC™ range does not come with pre-manufactured corners. The reason for this is that PLANC™ can be installed in many different patterns, which makes manufacturing a corner detail quite difficult without locking clients in to a set pattern.

So, let's dive right into this very important topic. There are <b>3 primary ways</b> to manage corners, and which one you choose may depend on whether you’re still in the planning phase, or already in the middle of your installation.

Option 1: (During Installation) Miter your corners (Hint: This is the Preferred option)
Option 2: (Pre-Installation) Polish your Cut Ends, and Overlap them
Option 3: (Post-Installation) Use a light stone enhancer to deepen your cut ends to mimic a thoughtful corner detail.

<b>Method 1: Mitering.</b> Our preferred method for handling corners is to miter them. Unlike our Rock Panels, XL Rock Panels, SL Rock Panels, or AKSENT, our PLANC™ range is a highly consistent thickness, which makes it very easy to miter.

Mitering your corners gives you the cleanest look and the appearance as if your PLANCs are “wrapping” around your corner, which is commonly considered the best aesthetic by designers and architects familiar with our product.

To miter your corners, you first need to ensure you have a tilting wet saw, specifically the kind where the motor and blade turn (note: there are wet saws which do not tilt, but which come with accessories that hoist your product on a 45 degree angle. Due to the length of our PLANC™ veneers, we do not recommend this type.) Here are the steps needed:

1.	Determine what kind of pattern you’d like for your PLANC installation (patterns include: Running Bond, Straight Stack, ½ Step, 1/3 Step).
2.	As you begin installing PLANC™, it is recommended that you start at your corners.
3.	With your pattern as your guide, you will simply measure out your cut point on your PLANC tile, mark it with your pencil, and bring your piece of PLANC to your wet saw.
4.	Depending on where you need to place your cut, you may be able to make a straight cut first.
5.	When ready, turn your tile saw on a 45 degree angle and run your first miter cut.
6.	Finally, turn your opposing piece over so it is face-down on the tray, and run your second miter cut.
7.	Test your cut by placing both pieces together to confirm you have a clean edge detail.
8.	Ensure you are using a new, continuous rim diamond blade for best results.

<b>Method 2: Polishing the Ends of your PLANC™ material using an angle grinder and a polishing pad.</b>

<b>Note:</b> This only applies to polished versions of the product: Grey, Ebony, and Graphite. Platinum and Silver Grey should not be polished.

We’ve been asked before about polishing the ends of our PLANC™ veneers after an installation has already taken place, mainly because the installer did not have a plan for mitering their corners, and simply went ahead with cutting-and-overlapping the ends. This can create an unsightly appearance.

Unfortunately, due to the process of polishing, it’s not recommended to attempt a polishing operating after the material has been installed.

If you wish to polish the ends of your material prior to installation and then use those polished ends to create a clean overlapping corner, then that is an option.

Here is a step by step guide to polishing PLANC natural stone veneers.

To begin, you will need the following:
1.	Adjustable Speed Angle Grinder (note polishing happens at lower speeds than cutting, so an adjustable speed angle grinder will ensure you find the appropriate speed for your polishing operation)
2.	C Clips
3.	Stone Polishing Pads – Grit 50, 100, 200, and 400
4.	Bucket with water and a rag

Follow the steps per below:

<b>Step 1:</b>  Using C Clips, start by clipping a full set of PLANC to your work bench. This works best if you stack them end to end or on top of one another.
<b>Step 2:</b> Saturate the end of the clipped PLANC with a wet rag.
<b>Step 3:</b> Using an Angle Grinder and a 50 Grit polishing pad, being applying polishing pressure to the end of the PLANC. Ensure you maintain an even perpendicular orientation to the stone and move across the stone with even pressure for best results.
<b>Step 4:</b> Repeat Step 3 with 100 Grit, 200 Grit, and 400 Grit pads, saturating the stone each time between polishings.

Once you’ve polished your PLANC ends to meet your needs, you may use them to create overlapping corners.

<b>Method 3: Using a stone enhancer to deepen the color of your cut ends.</b>

This method is most commonly used after an installation has taken place where the installer did not miter their corners, but instead simply cut and overlapped them. This method is most helpful in darkening the cut ends, which gives them the appearance of having been polished even though they are not.

Note: It’s very important to test all enhancing sealers on cut pieces prior to applying them to your installation to verify results are as intended. Enhancers are permanent and therefore you must be absolutely certain that the look you are going for can be made using the enhancer you have chosen.

To utilize this method, there are some basic ground rules to follow:

<b>Step 1: Procure the right enhancer.</b> You may want to sample several different kinds before settling on one. We like Aquamix Enrich N Seal and Stonetech Water Based Enhancer & Sealer.
<b>Step 2: Tape Protected Areas.</b>Using painter tape, apply a clean edge of tape over any areas you do not wish to receive sealer.
<b>Step 3: Use only a SMALL amount of Enhancer.</b> Dampen a clean cloth with your enhancing sealer, and take care not to oversaturate your cloth, as too much sealer can over-enhance the look.
<b>Step 4: Apply Evenly.</b> Apply a light, but even coat of enhancer on the cut edge of the stone, and take care not to get any enhancer anywhere else on the stone.
<b>Step 5: Allow to dry.</b>

Results from this method will vary depending on the enhancer chosen and the amount of enhancer applied. Care should be taken with this method, and always test your enhancer on a scrap piece of stone to verify results are as intended.
