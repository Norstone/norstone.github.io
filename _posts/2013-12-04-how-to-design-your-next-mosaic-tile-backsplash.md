It is also extremely important to feel visually comfortable in order to be able to fully enjoy what is generally known as the busiest room in the house. In this Norstone Designer Series blog we will be discussing the use of mosaic tile options for the kitchen, which would primarily be used for [backsplashes](/gallery/application/backsplash/). To start with a little background, mosaic originated as the art of creating images with an assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. Mosaics are rooted in ancient times and are one of mankind's oldest art forms.  They continue to endure as a globally popular and, with today's technology, economical form of interior decoration. Most mosaics are made of small, flat, multi shaped pieces of stone or glass that comes in many different colors, known as Tesserae, but mosaics, especially floor mosaics, may also be made of small rounded pieces of stone and called "pebble mosaics". With modern day building supplies, design materials and tools, the choices for mosaic patterns, colors and application ideas are virtually endless. The use of ceramics, stained glass and metal are part of the list of the mosaic family of products as well.

<h2>The Mosaic Tile Backsplash Today</H2>
![Mosaic tile backsplash bubbles](/assets/images/blog/Mosaic-Tile-Backsplash---Bubbles.jpg){: align="right"}Mosaic tile backsplashes are a popular feature in current kitchen design. One drawback with authentic piece by piece hand laid mosaics is that they are time consuming to install and require an artist's touch to transform individual pieces into what eventually becomes art. The talent level needed for this type of application is extremely high and should be strictly handled by professionals that have lots of training and experience at this method of installation, which increases the cost and time needed for installation. Tile manufacturers are meeting consumer's demands for mosaic applications by pre-mounting the mosaics onto various backing systems, including mesh and plastic. By pre-mounting the mosaic to a backer, the mosaic can be installed in standard size sections, similar to any other wall tile, and will often interlock with neighboring sections. While a pre-mounted mosaic tile product might not have the "hand laid" feel of traditional mosaic, they are much easier to install and are often tackled as a DIY project by homeowners.

<h2>Kitchen Mosaic Backsplashes</H2>
Backsplashes are not only important in setting the design theme of the space, they also serve an important purpose in the workability of a kitchen by providing a hard, durable surface underneath the cabinets and above the countertops.  When considering different kitchen backsplash tile durability and cleanability are important factors not to be overlooked. Expect this area to be exposed to all sorts of food, moisture and other grime, as well as the cleaning agents used to routinely clean up these areas. The good news is that a mosaic backsplash is going to be well suited to stand up to what can be a harsh environment for a product. Consider how a kitchen is used, what kind of cooking is done, and who is doing the cleaning when considering what kind of backsplash tile product for a space.  And don't be afraid to make bold choices, such as using a stacked stone panel for a backsplash while hedging your bets with a glass splatter guard installed near the cooktop to keep maintenance easy.

<h2>Special Note on Bathroom Backsplashes</H2>
While we've been mainly focused on using mosaics for kitchen backsplash tile, bathroom backsplashes are another space in the home where this type of product makes a ton of design sense. The nice part about bathrooms is that they are generally going to be smaller spaces, so the time and money needed for a backsplash tile project is less than a kitchen.  We love it when a designer or homeowner really pushes the limit with a bathroom mosaic backsplash, either through a unique variety of colors used or an interesting type of medium such as wood, pebbles, glass, stone, ceramic tile, etc.   

<h2>Mosaic Tile Backsplash Ideas</H2>
The possibilities are endless and possibily even overwhelming when it comes to kitchen backsplash tile.  Just walk through any tile and stone showroom and you'll see tons of space dedicated to displaying the latest products for backsplashes. With good reason as these products tend to be unique, interesting, and beautiful, and are a lot more fun to dream about and design with as compared to most floor tiles. Some varieties of mosaic backsplash tile that you'll find include mosaics made from stone, glass, ceramic and porcelain tile, hand painted tile, and water jet cut mosaics.  Most backsplash tile mosaics these days are on a mesh backing system which allows for a simple installation over a cementious substrate such as cement board using a tile thinset and often grout.  Peel and Stick backsplash tile is a newer offering in the mosaic backsplash world and tends to be focused around slightly lower end products that are lightweight.  Peel and Stick backsplash tile is just like the name implies, where you peel a sheet off the back of the mosaic revealing a sticky backer that sticks up against the wall.

Mosaic tile backsplashes also provide an extensive range of color and pattern options. Whether you prefer a monochromatic, minimalist look or a bold, eclectic design, mosaic tiles can accommodate your vision. The small tile size allows for intricate designs and patterns that can be customized to match your kitchen's aesthetic.

For those who crave a timeless appeal, classic subway tile patterns, herringbone layouts, or simple grid designs remain popular choices. On the other hand, contemporary kitchens often feature bold geometric patterns, colorful motifs, or even custom artwork in mosaic tile form. The ability to mix and match colors and shapes ensures that mosaic backsplashes can complement any kitchen style, from rustic farmhouse to sleek and modern.
