  heading: Norstone Creates Feature Walls with Impact
  body: Norstone <a href='/products/stacked-stone-cladding'>Rock Panels</a> are a
    great choice for any interior stone veneer project where a unique and fresh look
    is desired.  We work on projects ranging from entryways to alcoves, stairwells,
    accent and feature walls, powder rooms, fireplaces and many more. Essentially
    where any interior stacked stone wall is desired, Norstone is a natural fit.  It
    actually never ceases to amaze the team at Norstone the different ways our customers
    dream up to use our products for just about any indoor stone veneer projects.
    And as building products continue to get more and more advanced, we are seeing
    a <a href='/blog/norstone-diy-infographic/'>rise in DIY construction</a> using
    our stone wall panels because of how easy they are to install.
- heading: Starting Out Right
  body: The most important consideration for an interior stone veneer project is making
    sure the wall itself is suitable for installation. Norstone's <a href='/products/stacked-stone-cladding/'>Stacked
    Stone Rock Panels</a> weigh about 12.5 lbs / sq ft, which is pretty light when
    you think about the end product, but still most drywall or sheetrock wall substrates
    just aren't unsuitable for an interior rock wall installation. This isn't because
    they aren't strong enough, it's because drywall is essnetially gypsum and paper
    - and when you think about it that way, it's not something on which you'd naturally
    want to apply natural stone.  That said, this is easily remedied by installing
    cement board over the existing wallboard and then you can begin installing the
    interior stone veneer over the freshly prepared substrate. Stone veneer interior
    walls have never been this easy. In the past, they would require all sorts of
    special treatments and about a month on a mason's calendar. For more details on
    how to install stone veneer panels on interior walls check out our installation
    instructions. </p><a href='/how-to-install-stacked-stone'>Norstone&rsquo;s Installation

- heading: Finishing Touches are Key
  body: A number of options are available for adding extra design elements to an interior
    stone veneer wall panels. One of the most popular is lighting, which can be projected
    either upward, downward, or designed to back light the stone, and controlled for
    brightness and color.  Art pieces can also be incorporated into an interior stacked
    stone project, using a diamond-tipped masonry drill bit to drill through the stone
    to set the anchor points.
