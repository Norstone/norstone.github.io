    to <a href='/blog/natural-stone-bathrooms-designing-norstone-series/'>design natural
    stone into their private bathroom renovations.</a> Natural stone has long been

  heading: Stone Shower Walls Now Possible & Incredibly Simple
  body: Creating a natural stone shower wall from a dry stacked thin veneer product
    like Norstone Rock Panels was impossible just a few years ago, but thanks to advancements
    in waterproofing technology, you can now achieve a fully water proofed substrate
    to which any natural stone or tile can be installed over using a thinset bed method.
    This waterproofing layer prevents water intrusion into the cement board substrate
    and wall cavity and directs the water, with gravity's help, to the shower pan
    and drain. Never before has It been easier to have stacked stone in shower applications
    and since Norstone panels are 100% natural stone, you also have a <a href='/blog/cast-stone-vs-natural-stone-â€“-norstone-industry-series/'>superior
    and more durable product</a> than any other faux stone shower panels on the market.

  heading: Shower Rock Should Always be Sealed & Maintained
  body: Stone veneer used in a shower should be sealed upon completion of the installation
    with a quality water based natural stone sealer and resealed at regular intervals
    per the sealer manufacturer's recommendations.  When necessary, the stone is best
    cleaned using detergent based soaps and a stiff plastic bristle brush.  An exhaust
    fan is helpful to evacuate the moist air out of the shower stall during and after
    each use, helping keep the stone veneer shower wall clean.Natural stone veneer by its very nature does require more maintenance than a ceramic wall tile in exchange for turning an plain boring shower into something extraordinary.</p><p><a href='/assets/pdfs/Norstone-Short-and-Long-Term-Maintenance-Guidelines.pdf'>Norstone's

  heading: A Natural Stone Shower is a Centerpiece to Envy
  body: Norstone Rock Panels when used as stone shower wall panels will instantly
    become the centerpiece of the bathroom. A natural stone shower or bath has been
    a symbol of prestige for centuries and surpasses any ordinary ceramic, river rock, or porcelain
    tile alternative that you'll typically see on showers. Opt for the light coloring of Norstone White or Ivory Rock Panels for a luxurious spa look that evokes cleanliness and openness, ideal qualities for small spaces. So if you're looking to
    make a statement in your bath design, a stacked stone shower is a great choice
    that will stand the test of time from both a design and durability standpoint.

    standard ceramic or porcelain tile.
