  heading: Stacked Stone Fireplaces for Today's Homes.
  body: Fireplaces are a natural gathering place, and are often not just the focal
    point of a room, but often the focal point of the entire home, proving a respite
    of warmth, conversation, and meditation from the outside world. Experts agree
    that renovating a tired, worn out, and outdated fireplace has the same return
    on investment as updating a kitchen or bathroom, but with a much smaller price
    tag. <a href='/products/stacked-stone-cladding/'>Natural stone veneer panels</a>
    are an excellent choice for such a renovation because they are cost effective
    and incredibly <a href='/how-to-install-stacked-stone/'>easy to install.</a> All types of natural stones can be used for fireplaces depending on the desired color and texture desired.

  heading: The World's Finest Corner Detail for our Fireplace Stone Tile.
  body: "<a href='/blog/norstone-classroom-session-working-corners-1/'>Corners are
    one of the single most important details</a> to choosing any stacked stone veneer
    for a fireplace. So we poured over every detail and concept for making the perfect
    corner. After carefully manufacturing and testing one iteration after another,
    we eventually concluded that - for a thin natural stacked stone veneer to “turn
    a corner” properly - it had to be crafted using “fingers” that seamlessly interlock…as
    if they were made that way in nature. There are other ways to finish a corner,
    <a href='/blog/designing-norstone-series-edge-options/'>such as using trim options</a>,
    but after renovating tens of thousands of fireplaces we recommend you don’t settle
    for less than the finger joint system when it comes to this detail."

  heading: Fireplace Stone in the Perfect Colors and Styles.
  body: Whether you&rsquo;re envisioning a rustic, colonial, contemporary, modern,
    or Old World space, color and design add up to making your project look just right.
    Natural Stone Colors vary naturally, which is what makes it an authentic material
    to incorporate into projects. Our four colors, <a href='/products/rock-panels/ochre'>Ochre</a>,
    <a href='/products/rock-panels/charcoal'>Charcoal</a>, <a href='/products/rock-panels/white'>White</a>,
    and <a href='/products/rock-panels/ivory'>Ivory</a> can be easily adapted into
    all color schemes and the clean lines of the product are equally well suited to
    all different types of design. Natural stones inherently reflect nature, so choose a color and style that accentuates the space in which it's being used.

  heading: Natural Stones are the Superior Fireplace Veneer Choice.
  body: Natural stones used on fireplaces is a classic combination yet very adaptable to today's design trends.  Many fireplace surrounds today are long linear gas units that balance both a design aesthetic as well as heating needs.  More traditional stacked stone fireplaces are still incredibly popular, especially when paired with more modern finishes like white stone or honed dimensional panels.  Norstone has a wide range of natural stones to choose from for stacked stone fireplaces ranging from easy to install panel systems to mason laid individual stones for a truly bespoke look.

  heading: Our Team Can Turn Your Stone Fireplace Ideas into Reality.
  body: Whether you&rsquo;re renovating an old brick fireplace, or building one anew,
    our world-class customer service team will walk you through the right process
    for you. During a fireplace renovation, you tend to encounter more obstacles than
    if you are building new. For example, is your existing fireplace built from brick?
    Is it flat drywall? There are different ways to handle each of these conditions.</p>

  heading: Hearths, Mantles & More
  body: One of the most common questions we hear about fireplaces is what to choose
    for a hearth and mantle. Because contemproary design tends to be minimalist in
    nature, many modern gas fireplaces that use Norstone for their stone surround
    do not have hearths, and their mantles tend to be smooth and of a static color.
    Many of our rustic fireplace designs, however, opt for wooden mantles and granite
    hearthstones. Different types of natural stones like marble or travertine can also be used to either complement or contrast the stone veneer from either a color or texture standpoint. Be sure to peruse our galleries for projects that look like yours
    to get a better idea of the right design for you.

  heading: Stone Veneer Fireplaces The Easy Way
  body: Fireplace stone veneer allows you to achieve the look of a traditional stack
    stone fireplace without the thickness and weight of traditional full bed masonry
    veneer. Not all natural stones can be cut and hand crafted into thin veneer panels, so trust in Norstone's nearly 20 years experience in finding, sourcing, and manufacturing the best stone vener panels the planet. Whether you just need a stacked stone fireplace surround or want the look
    to go floor to ceiling, our panel system is a cost and labor effective solution
