  heading: Natural Stone Exterior for Curb Appeal
  body: When it comes to exterior design and creating curb appeal, natural stone is an excellent choice for creating long term value on a property. Whether it's a more traditional stacked stone look like Norstone XL Rock Panels offer, or a modern incarnation of a stone exterior using the Planc large format natural stone tile system, there is a product to suit.

  heading: Real Stone vs Other Materials
  body: When working on home improvement projects, especially large exterior applications, always consider more than just the square foot cost of the product and installation, but also the lifetime cost of the product. A product like vinyl siding might offer a lower up front cost but will need repainted and eventually replaced much faster than a real stone product. Faux stone manufacturers might offer a lower day 1 installed cost than real stone veneer, but with natural materials you know you'll be selecting a material with exceptional durability that often looks better over time.

    src: assets/images/unsorted/Grey-Stone-Column-and-Wainscot.jpg
  heading: Accents, Columns, Wainscots
  body: Natural stone veneer is typically not used across the entire exterior of a home, instead stone is typically used in accent areas, on columns, or as a wainscot. Accent areas, such as a natural bump out or surrounding the entryway, columns, and wainscots, where the stone is installed the first couple feet up a wall and then capped, allow the stone to serve as a focal point without a huge square foot commitment of stone on a project.

  heading: A Natural, Neutral Color Pallete
  body: The rich, earthy colors and textures of natural stone can complement a variety of architectural styles, from rustic cottages to modern mansions. We've designed all of our natural stone veneer products to explore the entire range of neutral tones from whites and browns to greys and blacks, making them ideal options for enhancing the beauty, design, and long term value of a home's exterior.

  heading: Durability to last a lifetime
  body: Natural stone veneer is renowned for its exceptional durability when used in exterior house applications. Its resistance to extreme weather conditions, such as freezing temperatures and moisture, ensures that it maintains its structural integrity and aesthetic appeal for many years, making it a reliable choice for long-lasting and low-maintenance home exteriors. Norstone natural stone veneers offer system warranties from 10 to 25 years, depending on the application type, so you know the product and installation method being recommended will stand the test of time.

  heading: Beyond the House Exterior and into the Landscape
  body: Natural stone products offer a perfect jumping off point to tie a home's exterior design and style into the landscape. Whether that's a retaining wall, outdoor fire pit, pool water feature, or outdoor kitchen, all of these types of projects benefit from the cohesiveness of well thought out and executed exterior design plan.

    <p class="text-justify">Certain things like corrosive cleaning agents, excessive salt, or other chemicals that might be present in an exterior installation can potentially harm the finish of a stone cladding project.  Sealing the stone with a water based, penetrating sealer post installation is a good idea to maintain and protect the stone finish over time.</p>
