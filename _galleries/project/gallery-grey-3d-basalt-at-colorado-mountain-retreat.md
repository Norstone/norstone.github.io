  heading: The Details
  body: This amazingly well designed residence North of Denver successfully marries
    two different types of stone in one jaw dropping fireplace.  Only surpassed by
    the amazing view of the Rocky Mountains out the windows, the clean grey lines
    of the 3D panel flank a vertical strip of lighter colored stone, beckoning all
    who see this installation to tilt their heads up to see and take in the amazing
    light fixtures and ceiling detail.

  heading: A Parade Worthy Project
  body: "\"Norstone delivers quality products that make a statement in any application.
    When it came time to select finishes for the Parade of Homes project's fireplace,
    we knew we had to use the 3D basalt tile. The mix of texture with modern clean
    lines was a perfect compliment to the home's mountain modern style. We continue
    to receive praise on how great the fireplace looks! It is always a pleasure working
    with Norstoneâ€™s amazing staff, they offer the support needed to make every project
    a success.\"  \n\n- Bekah Spaude\nInterior Designer\nSpringhaus Designs, LLC\n"
