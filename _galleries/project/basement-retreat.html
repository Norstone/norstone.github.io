  heading: R&amp;R Never Looked So Good
  body: Ochre Rock Panels adorn nearly every wall of the lower level in this home in the city of brotherly love. The stone forms a perfect backdrop to frame a modern gas fireplace as well as signed Van Halen Guitar and serves as a functional bar backsplash and feature wall in the theatre nook of this custom designed lower level space. The clean and linear design of the Rock Panel is in full display as its more traditional brown &amp; grey color tones work perfectly with the modern style and furnishings of this space.

  body: "The Philadelphia Basement project highlights the need for sufficient and varied lighting in any project that will recieve little or no sunlight, particularily when stone is involved.  The use of drop pendants, recessed cans, halogen pins, and a very cool backlit bottle rack all combine with the warm glow of the gas fireplace to bring out the brown earth tones of the Ochre Rock Panel and create a warm and inviting multi use space.</p><p><a href='/products/rock-panels/ochre/'>Visit Product Page</a>"

  heading: Finished Basement Goals
  body: "If you've got an ugly basement right now and dream of turning that space into something special, natural stone veneer is always a great design option to consider. Stone for a finished basement project is a natural fit with the space being underground and for when a strong but refined design scheme is the inspiration. Whether your finished basement project includes a pool table, bar, poker corner, or all of the above, a stone accent wall is something to consider."

  heading: Basement Bar Design
  body: "Basement Bars are an incredibly popular addition to any finished basement project and one of the most common parts of a basement remodel project. Some popular basement bar ideas that incorporate a stacked stone wall or stone accent wall include using the stone on the bar back as a backsplash as seen in this project, as well as using it on the face of the bar, which offers a very durable surface that will hold up over heavy use."

  heading: Basement Design Challenges
  body: "A basement remodel is usually a renovation project that poses its fair share of challenges. From lack of natural light, working around support poles and low ceilings, or maybe even building out a basement bedroom for guests, be ready for all sorts of curve balls in a typical basement remodel. Creative solutions that we see in this project, such as having varied light sources from the fireplace, to the pendants, to the backlit shelving are all great ideas to solve design challenges."
