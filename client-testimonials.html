      We have finished our kitchen and are very pleased with the outcome using your product. We used the standard Ochre stacked stone up over our cabinets and for our backsplash. We used the XL Ochre stone on our Island. It is absolutely beautiful. I am so glad we found this web site. I would highly recommend your product to anyone! Thanks so much.&rdquo;
