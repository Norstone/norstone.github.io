                <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Where can I buy Norstone products?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Please email us via our contact page to be put in touch with your nearest distributor or in the event no distributor has been identified for your area, someone from Norstone will contact you directly on how to purchase.</em></p>
                <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How much do Norstone products cost?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Normal retail pricing falls between $14 and $16 per sq ft for our Rock Panel lines and $18 per sq ft for the Basalt IL tiles, often with sizeable discounts for larger orders.  Contact Norstone for your nearest distributor to receive a quote on your project today.</em></p>
                <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How does the cost of Rock Panels compare to a typical stacked stone veneer wall?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Since there is far less labor involved in installing Rock Panels as compared to hand stacking individual stones, the installed cost of Rock Panels can be as little as half or one third of the cost to build a typical stacked stone veneer wall.</em></p>
                <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How does the cost of Rock Panels compare to imitation stone panels or tiles?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Norstone natural stone Rock Panels are very competitive compared to imitation stone panels, however offer the obvious benefit of a natural product versus a faux or manmade product.</em></p>
                <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; What is the lead time for Norstone products?</p>
                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Norstone and its Distributors strive to keep plenty of on hand inventory to meet our customer&rsquo;s needs.

                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How do I calculate the quantity I need?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Measure each area to receive Norstone products and allow 10% extra for wastage.  If outside corners are present in the project, measure the height of all the outside corners and contact your Norstone representative or local distributor to make sure you order the right mix of field units and corner units for your project.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How are Norstone products laid?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Norstone products should be laid in a continuous running bond pattern, ensuring vertical seams do not line up from one course to the other.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; What adhesive does Norstone recommend?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>We recommend a polymer modified tile thinset that meets or exceeds ANSI 118.4 and ANSI 118.11 adhesion standards.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How are Norstone products cut?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Norstone products are ideally cut on a tile wet saw with a continuous diamond rimmed blade.  In the event a tile saw cannot perform the necessary cut, such as a curve, a hand held angle grinder can be used to cut the stone as well.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Are Norstone products easy to install?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Most competent home handymen can install Norstone products, particularly those with experience tiling. &nbsp;In fact both Rock Panels and Basalt IL tiles have been featured on the DIY Network because they are easy to use and great looking.  If a professional is to be hired to do the work, a tile setter is the ideal tradesperson.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Do Norstone products require mechanical fixing?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Mechanical fixing might be necessary when your installation reaches a certain height, sometimes as low as 10&rsquo;, depending on the structural  engineering of the wall the stone is being installed on.  Please consult your architect or engineer and check local building codes for specific requirements.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Do Norstone products need sealing?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Sealers might be a good option for Rock Panel installations depending on the nature of the installation, for example a kitchen backsplash, walk in shower, or exterior water feature.  Consult your Norstone representative or local distributor to determine if sealing might be a good option for your project.  <br />
</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><em>All Basalt IL tile installations should be sealed to preserve the look and feel of this honed and polished stone.  <br />
</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><em>Sealers may also be used on any stone installation if a color enhanced look or different sheen is desired for the application.  Always use a penetrating water based sealer according to the manufacturer&rsquo;s application instructions and test the sealer out on a scrap piece of stone before applying to the application.  </em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Are Norstone products easy to maintain?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Yes! Natural stone is robust, easy to keep clean and does not fracture, deteriorate or lose color over time.  The only maintenance on Norstone products should involve cleaning off surface contaminants (dust, dirt, etc) using water, a mild detergent if necessary, and a stiff bristle brush.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><em>If sealed, the stone should continue to be resealed per the sealer manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended timeline.</em></p>

                <div class="section-body">
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; What are Norstone Rock Panels?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Norstone Rock Panels are a 6&rdquo; tall x 24&rdquo; long panel that is made up of individual pieces of natural stone, that have been fit and glued together to create a modular system that is easy to install, and creates the beautiful look of stacked stone veneer without the labor of hand stacking individual stones.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; What is the difference between Rock Panels and XL Rock Panels?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>XL Rock Panels are a super sized version of the standard series Rock Panel with stone sizes approximately twice as big as the standard series and a unique interlocking edge profile designed to create a seam free look with the larger XL format.  XL Rock Panels are ideal for large scale projects, both interior and exterior, where a larger size stone might better fit the scale of the project.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; What size do Rock Panels come in?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Each Rock Panel is 6&rdquo; tall and 24&rdquo; wide.  XL Rock Panels have an interlocking design to complement the larger sized stones in this product, whereas standard series Rock Panels work best when simply butt together on both the horizontal and vertical.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How much do Rock Panels weigh?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Each Rock Panel weighs on average about 12.5 lbs per sq ft.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Are Corner Units available?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><em><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Outside Corner Units are available for both standard and XL Rock Panels.  Each corner unit is 6&rdquo; tall to match up with the field units and returns approximately 8&rdquo; on one side of the corner and 16&rdquo; on the other.  We recommend consulting your Norstone representative or local distributor to ensure your project has the correct mix of field and corner units.</em></em>
                  </p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><em><em>Inside Corners are handled by either using a standard inside corner miter cut, or butting panels together and filling the joint with either mortar or caulk.</em></em>
                  </p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How do Rock Panels come packaged?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>There are 4 Rock Panels per box, equal to 4 square feet per box, 48 boxes per crate or 192 square feet per crate.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How many colors are available?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Norstone offers four colors in standard series Rock Panels: Ochre, Charcoal, Ivory, and White.</em></p>

                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; What holds Rock Panels together?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Our Rock Panels are hand made from select pieces of cut premium natural stone, which are then adhered together using a high quality 2-part epoxy adhesive.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Is each Rock Panel different?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Yes, like a finger print, each panel is unique in design, color blend and texture.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How do Norstone Rock Panels compare to other stone veneers?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Using only the highest grade natural stone stock and epoxy adhesive materials, Norstone Rock Panels differentiate themselves with durability and design as the primary focus, and stand apart with a unique offering of colors other stone veneers cannot duplicate.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Are the backs of Rock Panels clean or fixed to some other material?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Rock Panels are clean, free of dust, dirt, adhesive residue or any foreign material on the back to allow maximum adhesion of the stone with the wall surface.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Why are Norstone Rock Panels superior to imitation or faux stone panels?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Norstone Rock Panels do not lose their color, texture or degrade due to age or exposure to weather, and since they are made from natural stone, they have an inherent advantage in &ldquo;believability&rdquo; as compared to an imitation or faux stone product.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull;&nbsp;Are Rock Panels held together with a mesh backing?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>No, Rock Panels do not use a mesh backing as it can seriously undermine the adhesive bond between the wall and the back of the Rock Panel given the weight of the product.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Are Rock Panels adhered together with polymer glues?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>No, we only use a 2 part epoxy adhesive in manufacturing Rock Panels for maximum strength and endurance.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Will the color of the stone fade?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>No, actually the color of the natural stone used in our Rock Panels will usually be enhanced with time.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Can Rock Panels be used in wet areas?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Yes, Rock Panels can be used in or near swimming pools, water features, near beachfronts or salt spray.  Consult your Norstone rep or local Norstone distributor to determine if any additional precaution, namely the application of a quality stone sealer, is recommended for your wet installation.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Can Rock Panels be used for paving?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>No, Rock Panels should only be used for wall veneer applications.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Do Rock Panels stain?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Natural stone may be adversely affected by cleaning with acid wash or the use of incorrect tile adhesive, so please only use detergent cleaners to wash or clean the stone before, during, and after installation, along with the correct setting materials as listed out in our installation guide.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Are Rock Panels affected by cold weather?</p>

                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; Are Rock Panels affected by heat?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Norstone Rock Panels can be used for wall cladding in extreme climates, such as 40 to 50 degrees Celsius or 104 to 122 Fahrenheit.  A common application for Rock Panels is fireplace veneer, however, Rock Panels should only be installed on the outward facing areas of a fireplace, and never exposed to a direct flame.</em></p>

                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>Basalt IL Tiles consist of 9 strips of Basalt, each 12&rdquo; long and coming in one of three heights: 1&rdquo;, 1.4&rdquo; and 2.4&rdquo;. Each tile unit covers 1.3 sq ft.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-question">Q &bull; How are corners addressed?</p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; Outside c<em>orners are handled either with an aftermarket corner trim piece which forms a functional and attractive finish for which the Basalt IL Tile can be butt up against, or a second option is to use strips of Basalt, cut from the tile units, in matching lengths and widths, and installing them parallel to and on both sides of the outside corner to form a border from which tile units can be cut and laid against.</em></p>
                  <p class="faq-answer"><em>Inside Corners are best handled by cutting the Basalt IL Tiles so that they butt join neatly with a small grout gap where they meet on the internal corner.</em></p>

                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>The mesh mat that Basalt IL Tiles are mounted on holds the product together and maintains spacing between individual strips, allowing for quicker installation and precise grout lines.</em></p>

                  <p class="faq-answer"><strong>A</strong> &bull; <em>No, actually the color of the natural stone used in our Basalt IL Tiles should stay consistent over many lifetimes assuming the proper application and re-application of a penetrating, water based sealer per the manufacturer&rsquo;s direction.</em></p>
