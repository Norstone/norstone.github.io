    <h3>Finding Smart Design in the Matrix</h3>
    <p>A stunning two story fireplace dominates the reception area of this contemporary styled boutique hotel located in the vibrant heart of Edmonton's downtown. The sleek and linear design of Norstone White Rock Panels, paired with a custom glass corner
        fireplace exudes a luxurious experience and demonstrates wonderfully the limitless possibilities of using natural stone for modern design and styling.</p>

    <h3>Featured Products &amp; Design</h3>
    <p>One of the reasons Norstone's White Rock Panels work so well in a modern design theme is that each stone in each White panel is the same height. &nbsp;This creates a very linear geometry to a completed installation, which then pairs with the bold
        color and distinctive texture of the White Quartz stone for an ultra modern look. &nbsp;The Matrix Hotel Lobby project, with it's soaring cielings and other modern design elements, is a perfect backdrop for the White Rock Panel to take center
        stage.</p>
