    <h3>A Virginia Treehouse Retreat</h3>
    <p>This rural Virginia home boasts an impressive offering of Norstone White Rock Panels throughout the main living areas. Starting in the formal living room, a two sided fireplace meets up with a stunning backsplash in the gourmet kitchen, which then
        transitions into a full height feature wall in the cozy family room. Paired flawlessly with wood flooring, dark cabinetry, and overstuffed furniture, this installation shows how White Rock Panels can still make a statement in a more traditional
        design &amp; decor scheme.</p>

    <h3>Featured Products &amp; Design</h3>
    <p>The Treehouse project is a classic example of creating flow across multiple spaces using materials and finishes. &nbsp;The dual sided fireplace, clad in White Rock Panels, welcomes the formal living room into the kitchen, which carries the stone onto
        the backsplash, before eventually opening up into the family room, allowing three distinct areas to flow together through the use of creative design and material selection.</p>
