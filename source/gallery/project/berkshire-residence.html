    <h3>XL Rock Panels In Action In Berkshire</h3>
    <p>Norstone recently completed this Ochre XL installation within the Grounds of a Magnificent Manor House in Berkshire. Janine Stone Architects/Interior Designers specified Norstone Ochre XL to be installed on a Wall that commences from the Indoor Gymnasium,
        which then continues uninterrupted through a sheet of Glass and continues on to the Water feature.</p>

    <h3>Featured Products &amp; Design</h3>
    <p>The larger format XL Series Rock Panel in Ochre is a great selection for this project due to the uninterrupted design and height of the wall stretching across three distinct areas. &nbsp;The larger individual stones of the XL Series&nbsp;add to the
        strength and durability motif of the indoor gymnasium, and as natural stone, add an air of zen to the outdoor terrace and water feature.</p>
