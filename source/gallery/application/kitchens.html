  heading: Stone on More than just the Countertop
  body: "There's good reason that natural stone, such as granite, marble, and quartz, are the most sought after kitchen countertop products - they're both beautiful and durable.  But wait - what about the rest of your kitchen?  Don't leave the wall spaces of your kitchen islands, half walls, over the cabinet space, and breakfast nooks barren.  Consider using a product like Norstone <a href='/products/stacked-stone-cladding/'>Rock Panels</a> to create a stacked stone kitchen feature wall that will be unique and durable."

  heading: Where We Gather
  body: The kitchen often serves as the center of the home, where we eat, do homework, pay bills, and check email.  Create a warm and welcoming environment with a stacked stone kitchen feature wall that will inspire you and your family and have your friends and relatives asking where you got the stone when they visit.

  heading: Practical Considerations
  body: A Natural Stone kitchen wall should be sealed with a quality water based natural stone sealer when it is installed and re-sealed per the sealer manufacturer's recommendations.  The sealer will form a protective barrier on the stone and help keep the wall clean during life's day to day activities.
