    <h3>Stone on More than just the Countertop</h3>
    <p>There's good reason that natural stone, such as granite, marble, and quartz, are the most sought after kitchen countertop products - they're both beautiful and durable. &nbsp;But wait - what about the rest of your kitchen? &nbsp;Don't leave the wall
        spaces of your kitchen islands, half walls, over the cabinet space, and breakfast nooks barren. &nbsp;Consider using a product like Norstone <a href="/products/stacked-stone-cladding">Rock Panels</a> to create a stacked
        stone kitchen feature wall that will be unique and durable.</p>

    <h3>Where We Gather</h3>
    <p>The kitchen often serves as the center of the home, where we eat, do homework, pay bills, and check email. &nbsp;Create a warm and welcoming environment with a stacked stone kitchen feature wall that will inspire you and your family and have your
        friends and relatives asking where you got the stone when they visit.</p>

    <h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
    <p>A Natural Stone kitchen wall should be sealed with a quality water based natural stone sealer when it is installed and re-sealed per the sealer manufacturer's recommendations. &nbsp;The sealer will form a protective barrier on the stone and help keep
        the wall clean during life's day to day activities.</p>
