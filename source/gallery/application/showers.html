    <h3>Bringing the Spa Home</h3>
    <p>Using Norstone <a href="/products/stacked-stone-cladding">Rock Panels</a> to create a natural stone shower wall is an excellent option for homeowners seeking to incorporate spa elements into their private bathrooms. Natural
        stone has long been a favorite finish of commercial spas for its rugged asethetic, durabilitiy, and sound dampening qualities, which can now be incorporated into a stone veneer shower wall straight out of a magazine.</p>

    <h3>Making It Possible</h3>
    <p>Creating a natural stone shower wall from a dry stacked thin veneer product like Norstone Rock Panels was impossible just a few years ago, but thanks to advancements in waterproofing technology, you can now achieve a fully water proofed substrate
        to which any natural stone or tile can be installed over using a thinset bed method. &nbsp;This waterproofing layer prevents water intrusion into the cement board substrate and wall cavity and directs the water, with gravity's help, to the shower
        pan and drain.</p>

    <h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
    <p>Stone veneer used in a shower should be sealed upon completion of the installation with a quality water based natural stone sealer and resealed at regular intervals per the sealer manufacturer's recommendations. &nbsp;When necessary, the stone is
        best cleaned using detergent based soaps and a stiff plastic bristle brush. &nbsp;An exhaust fan is helpful to evacuate the moist air out of the shower stall during and after each use, helping keep the stone veneer shower wall clean.</p>
