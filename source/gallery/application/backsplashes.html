    <h3>A Detail Worth Not Overlooking</h3>
    <p>More thought goes into the countertop, cabinets, appliances and layout of a kitchen, but one detail that anyone building or remodeling a kitchen shouldn't overlook is the backsplash. &nbsp;A stacked stone backsplash using Norstone <a href="http://www.norstoneusa.com/products/stacked-stone-cladding">Rock Panels</a>        is a unique take on the strip of space commonly found between the cabinets and countertop and you might be suprised that it'll end up being the first thing people see and talk about.</p>

    <h3>An option for every kitchen</h3>
    <p>A stone backsplash is one of the most durable finishes for the application, and by sealing the tile with a natural stone sealer, most household cleanup chores will be similar in involvement to other surfaces like ceramic and glass tile. &nbsp;So whether
        your kitchen is used hard every day, or barely used at all, Norstone Rock Panels make a great backsplash tile option.</p>

    <h3>Details make the Difference</h3>
    <p>Subtle details, such as under cabinet lighting or switch plates made of similar materials will allow your natural stone backsplash to pop off the wall. &nbsp;Dimmable incandescent lighting can be used to wash light over the tile backsplash, bringing
        out its warmer tones, and the panels themselves can be notched and your outlets and electrical boxes extended out to allow for your outlets and switches to be mounted at the same elevation as the stone.</p>

    <h3>The Start of Something Bigger</h3>
    <p>A stacked stone backsplash is a great introduction into working with natural stone rock panels and getting a feel for how versatile of a product it can be, springboarding the product into lots of other uses. &nbsp;Quickly, you'll be able to see how
        a half wall in the breakfast nook, fireplace in the living room, or media wall in the den could use a makeover and how stacked stone might be a good fit.</p>

    <h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
    <p>Sealing the tiles in your kitchen or bathroom stone backsplash is highly advised, allowing for much easier routine maintenance and cleaning of the application. &nbsp;From an installation standpoint, the backsplash is typically installed after the
        countertop, so care should be taken to cover the countertop during installation of the backsplash panels. &nbsp;While the backsplash panels can be installed all the way down to the countertop, you should guard against harsh, specifically acidic,
        cleaning agents coming into contact with the stone.</p>
