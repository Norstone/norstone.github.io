  heading: Starting Out Right
  body: "The most important consideration for an interior stone veneer project is making sure the wall itself is suitable for installation.  Norstone Rock Panels weigh about 12.5 lbs / sq ft, making most normal drywall or sheetrock wall substrates unsuitable for an interior rock wall installation.  This is easily remedied by installating cement board over the existing wallboard and then installing the interior stone veneer over the freshly prepared substrate.</p><a href='/how-to-install-stacked-stone'>Norstone&rsquo;s Installation Page</a>"

  heading: Finishing Touches
  body: A number of options are available for adding extra design elements to an interior stone veneer wall. One of the most popular is lighting, which can be projected either upward, downward, or designed to back light the stone, and controlled for brightness and color.  Art pieces can also be incorporated into an interior stacked stone project, using a diamond-tipped masonry drill bit to drill through the stone to set the anchor points.
