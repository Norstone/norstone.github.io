    <h3>100% Natural Stone, 100% Natural Beauty</h3>
    <p>Norstone <a href="http://www.norstoneusa.com/products/stacked-stone-cladding">Rock Panels</a> can be installed in wet environments without fading, cracking, or unnatural weathering. Being 100% natural stone, Norstone veneers were made outside and
        have been subjected to wet environments throughout their makeup.</p>

    <h3>Dimension matters</h3>
    <p>When choosing a ledgestone veneer for your pool’s risers and spill-ways, consider the fundamental dimensionality to the face of the product. Norstone Rock Panels and XL Rock Panels provide real dimension with world-class design.</p>

    <h3>Stone That Lasts</h3>
    <p>Norstone can be submerged because it’s 100% natural stone. It’s one of the most durable building products of all time. Chlorine? Salt Water? Go for it. Norstone is made from ultra-dense quartz, basalt, or quartzitic sedimentary rock, which means it
        stands up to any condition you want to put it through.</p>

    <h3>Create Style With Stone</h3>
    <p>Norstone is the stylish gem in any garden. Whether it’s the authentic earth-toned Ochre Blend or the cool toned Charcoal, either Rock Panel can turn your planters and landscaping walls into awe-inspiring features and focal points.</p>

    <h3>Practical Considerations</h3>
    <p>Pools are moisture rich environments, which means they need special care when installing. Norstone can be directly adhered to any pool wall, but we recommend using a waterproofing membrane, such as the Laticrete Hydroban product. Waterproofing your
        substrate can decrease the chance of efflorescence damaging your Norstone. We also recommend the use of a good quality penetrating sealer. Many exist in the market, but not all are equal. You can learn more from our team, or visit the recommended
        sealers on our installation guide page.</p>
