  heading: 100% Natural Stone, 100% Natural Beauty
  body: "Norstone <a href='/products/stacked-stone-cladding/'>Rock Panels</a> can be installed in wet environments without fading, cracking, or unnatural weathering. Being 100% natural stone, Norstone veneers were made outside and have been subjected to wet environments throughout their makeup."

  heading: Dimension matters
  body: When choosing a ledgestone veneer for your pool’s risers and spill-ways, consider the fundamental dimensionality to the face of the product. Norstone Rock Panels and XL Rock Panels provide real dimension with world-class design.

  heading: Stone That Lasts
  body: Norstone can be submerged because it’s 100% natural stone. It’s one of the most durable building products of all time. Chlorine? Salt Water? Go for it. Norstone is made from ultra-dense quartz, basalt, or quartzitic sedimentary rock, which means it stands up to any condition you want to put it through.

  heading: Practical Considerations
  body: Pools are moisture rich environments, which means they need special care when installing. Norstone can be directly adhered to any pool wall, but we recommend using a waterproofing membrane, such as the Laticrete Hydroban product. Waterproofing your substrate can decrease the chance of efflorescence damaging your Norstone. We also recommend the use of a good quality penetrating sealer. Many exist in the market, but not all are equal. You can learn more from our team, or visit the recommended sealers on our installation guide page.
