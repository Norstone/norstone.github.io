This Austrian house is a fully-furnished, fully-functional home tucked away into a hillside with absolutely breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains. The structure blends the comforts of a traditional house with the futurism of contemporary design. Set on stilts, it is built to maximize spectacular views while minimizing the environmental impact of its construction, a design choice rarely seen outside of beach communities. Windows, both small and large, provide light to every part of the building without sacrificing personal privacy, a consideration that’s often missed in the design of compact houses. The interior of the house is fairly minimal in style, dominated by a single wood finish and accented by clever little details in each room.

As much as we'd love to find a place for some our [Basalt IL Tiles](/products/modern-wall-tile) or maybe even the [Rock Panel Collection](/products/stacked-stone-cladding) on this puppy, it looks pretty positively perfect just the way it is.
