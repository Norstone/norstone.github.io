Many years ago I was fortunate enough to attend a class on the topic of project LEED certification and accreditation for continuing education credits at a trade show and learned a lot about this topic.  The trade show was geared towards floor and wall coverings and such the information had a decided bent towards our industry, but I still did take away some great information to assist and guide our clients that are interested in knowing how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/stacked-stone-cladding/&quot;&gt;stacked stone veneer&lt;/a&gt; can qualify for LEED credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a quick baseline understanding of what we’re talking about – LEED credits are credits or points that a construction project can earn a variety of ways, from what kind of products are used, how the construction process is managed and how ongoing building functions are designed just to name a few.  And in greatly simplifying the actual process, these credits are documented, presented to the US Green Building Council, and the project can be certified along a range of levels from simply being “certified” up the “platinum”.  While the idea of creating buildings that have less environmental impact would hopefully appeal to most everyone, developers might also be able to trade off certain impact fees or expedite a zoning or permitting process by proposing a LEED certified building.  In many areas, LEED certified&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/ebony-3d-panels-commercial-storefront/&quot;&gt; commercial projects&lt;/a&gt; will lease or sell at a premium to standard build outs.  Many large multi-national companies have also begun to institute policies where their new construction projects must achieve a certain LEED designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/20/Stacked Stone Veneer Installation on Commercial LEED Certified Project-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre Rock Panel Stone Veneer and Grey Aksent 3D Panel used on a LEED certified retail shopping project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to stacked stone veneer qualifying for or helping contribute to LEED credits, the biggest hurdle or industry faces is for the product to qualify it must be quarried and manufactured within 500 miles of the project.  This requirement is designed to minimize the emissions associated with the transportation of construction materials, but since we quarry and manufacture all of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;Norstone Natural Stone Veneer products&lt;/a&gt; in Southeast Asia, unfortunately the product credits are unattainable.  And while there are amazing stone regions in the United States, the reality is that in a country as big as this, 500 miles gets eaten up quickly.  So while that Pennsylvania Blue stone is beautiful, it’s not going to help your project in Texas.  The same goes for Texas Limestone, Wisconsin Granite, and Vermont Marble – all world class stone products made right here in the U.S., but if you fall outside that 500 mile radius of the quarry LEED product credits aren’t in your project’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there are other LEED credits that stacked stone veneer products like Norstone can help contribute to.  Two of thee points are related to construction waste management, as all of our packaging can be readily recycled, and any excess material can be turned into aggregate.  A third point relates to indoor air quality, which natural stone contributes to due to its low emission of volatile organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/20/Construction Waste Management on a Stacked Stone Veneer Project.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Stacked Stone contributing towards waste management credits on a LEED certified project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope in the future that more LEED credits will become available to products like stacked stone veneer and other tile and stone products.  Our industry associations, including the Tile Council of North America, are working with the US Green Building Council to make more credits available for tile and stone, hopefully with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-sustainably-remodel-your-home/&quot;&gt;sustainable building materials&lt;/a&gt; and the life cycle cost of products.  A new carpet made from recycled plastic water bottles is no doubt helping the environment, but could need replaced every 2-4 years in a commercial setting, where a beautiful natural stone floor could last many lifetimes.  The good news is that we’re having these discussions and all parties want to get it right, not just for certain industries, but with environmental impact as the guiding force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are considering using any of our stacked stone veneer products for a LEED certified project, please contact any of our team members to get more information on the credits available.  We look forward to continuing to see our industry and this process evolve and staying on the bleeding edge of knowing how LEED works for stacked stone veneer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">If you have a project that is looking to attain a certain LEED status, stacked stone veneer has some benefits that are worth considering.

A lot of work goes into bringing a new color to market, including preliminary market research and fully vetting the stone supply line to make sure the colors stay consistent from batch to batch and the volume can scale with us as demand is created.  We actually started prototyping these two colors, among many others, to some of our longtime dealers and distributors last summer for feedback, and were excited to start seeing production material come over and start to get stocked in our warehouses starting late spring / early summer of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What immediately stood out with these two new colors is how similar they were to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/aztec/&quot;&gt;Aztec XL&lt;/a&gt; Series color, which we released a couple years back and has been a very popular addition to the line up.  The colors are all unique among these three products, but they all share the same iridescence and sparkle that makes Aztec so popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/15/Norstone Sierra XL Stone Veneer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Sierra XL Stone Veneer Demo Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sierra is probably the color that we’re most excited about.  Open up any design magazine or walk into a model home in the past 5 years and you’ll have witnessed a grey takeover of the neutral color palette, pushing out the previously dominate beige tones of the mid 2000s on.  Sierra fits squarely in that color range with a very attractive color range that is mainly grey with an understated silvery touch to it, that all gets accented by the occasional gold and rust colored accents throughout.  The accents are so important to the overall look of this product, giving Sierra a depth of color that really looks amazing on the wall, and adding a distinct “naturalness” to the product that can’t be replicated with a faux or man-made stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/15/Norstone Pearl XL Stone Veneer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Pearl XL Stone VEneer Demo Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also really excited about Pearl, which is also perhaps the best fit for a product name that we have ever come up with.  Getting this product in your hands, whether seeing it at one of our dealer’s showroom on display or ordering a sample from our internal team, is the best way to see this product and really reveals the subtle variation of the off white hues and the “pearlescence” shine that gave this color its name.  We see this as a great product to use under a variety of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;lighting conditions&lt;/a&gt;, such as with natural light during the day and targeted LED light at night, as the stone will look quite different in each condition and really come alive on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point there was some consideration to grouping these three closely related colors, Pearl, Aztec, and Sierra, into their own series, but ultimately we decided it was best to expand our popular XL Series Stone Veneer Series with the new colors.  The XL Series offers the largest individual stone sizes, yet still a part of an easy to use 6”x24” panel system.  XL also comes with a staggered end profile to reduce the appearance of vertical seams, which is important the bigger the individual stones are, and also comes in both our outside corner unit and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/natural-ends-norstone-s-latest-addition-to-standard-and-xl-series-rock-panels/&quot;&gt;natural end finish unit&lt;/a&gt;, giving transitions and starts and stops a more finished look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve used our products before, or if you are just considering Norstone for your next stone veneer project, I would definitely encourage you to take a look at Pearl and Sierra as possible color options.  We’re incredibly happy and excited to put our 15 years of experience building thin stone veneer panel systems for sale to markets all across the world to use on these new products and look forward to seeing fantastic results with them for our current and future clients this year and beyond!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">This summer we officially launched two new colors in our XL Series Rock Panel Collection – Pearl and Sierra.

As anyone can attest, it’s a lot more fun and interesting to look at beautiful tiles from all around the world then a few pencil like strips of various color grout.  At Norstone, the only product we currently make that gets grouted is our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;Lynia Medium Format Mosaic Wall Tile&lt;/a&gt;.  Each Lynia tile unit consists of nine strips of either basalt or marble, that are each twelve inches long and come in three different heights.  The strips are mounted to a two layer backing system and staggered to create an interlocking mosaic wall tile and spaced out to create grout lines that are about 3 mm wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/25/Norstone Lynia Tile with Measurements.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Tile in Grey with Measurements shown in inches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to grouting the Lynia series, we focus on making sure our customers are using the right type of grout, helping them understand how the grout color can change the way a product looks and needs to be installed, and finally proper techniques for grouting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of grout that can be used to install the Lynia mosaic wall tiles, either un-sanded or epoxy grout.  Un-sanded grout is designed for grout lines that are less than 1/8” wide, which the Lynia tiles fall into, and if sanded grout was used there’s also the potential that the grit of the sand will swirl or mark up the honed finish of the Lynia tiles.  Epoxy grout is another option, which typically comes pre-mixed.  When asked for a recommendation, we suggest the un-sanded grout since it is easier for most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/selecting-the-right-installer-for-your-next-tile-or-stone-project/&quot;&gt;tile installers&lt;/a&gt;, both professional and DIY, to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/25/Dark Grout Color on Lynia Mosaic Wall Tile Installation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Tile in Ebony installed with a dark matching grout color on a large modern fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grout color is another really important aspect of a project to consider when working with the Lynia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/mosaic-tile-backsplash-norstone-designer-series/&quot;&gt;mosaic wall tiles&lt;/a&gt;.  Selecting a grout color that is slightly lighter than the stone is a good rule of thumb as it still allows the linear nature and design of the tiles to come through, but is more forgiving in terms of making sure all the grout lines line up and are consistent in size and spacing.  This is especially true for mosaic tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/25/Light Contrasting Grout Color on Lynia Mosaic Wall Tile Installation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Tile in Grey installed with a light contrasting grout color on an outdoor feature wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting a grout that is contrasting in color to the stone can serve to really bring out the design of the product, but requires a lot more skill and patience to get the install just right (think 100s of spacers to make sure the spacing is just right on both the horizontal and vertical gaps.  When done well, the Lynia tiles will really look amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fully cover how to install this product in our downloadable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/assets/pdfs/Norstone_Installation%20Guide_Basalt-2016.pdf&quot;&gt;Lynia Series Installation Guide&lt;/a&gt;, but for purposes of today’s discussion, we’ll focus on just the highlights of the grouting process itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as technique is concerned, grout should be applied about 24 hours or longer after the tiles have been installed, and any excess thinset should be cleaned off the face of the tiles.  If the grout is not pre-mixed, it should be mixed per the manufacturer’s instructions, and you’re generally looking for a consistency that is a little less stiff than smooth peanut better, but not runny.  A grout float is used to press and compress the grout into the gaps and lightly scrape off excess grout from the face of the tile.  Use a sponge and clean water to remove the excess grout, taking care not to dig any of the grout out from the gaps.  When sponging off natural stone tile, its very important that you use a lot of clean water and constantly are rinsing the sponge.  The cleaner your sponge is the less grout haze you’ll end up with in a day or two!  The grout will end up being sealed as part of our recommendation to seal the entire stone installation once the grout haze is removed.&lt;/p&gt;

This project done about two years ago consists of an outdoor kitchen and feature wall done in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/aztec/&quot;&gt;Aztec XL Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;.  The stone is beautiful but what we really like about this project is how every inch of space is used to the max creating multiple areas to actually “live” in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stacked-stone-for-outdoor-living/&quot;&gt;outdoor living space&lt;/a&gt;.  Let’s take a closer look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/24/Aztec Stacked Stone Outdoor Kitchen Orlando.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Aztec Stacked Stone Panels used on the base of an outdoor kitchen in Florida with grill, sink, and fridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first area the stone was used in is as the base for the outdoor kitchen.  Complete with a sink, grill, and refrigeration, this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stacked-stone-outdoor-kitchen/&quot;&gt;stacked stone outdoor kitchen&lt;/a&gt; has got pretty much everything you need to cook a nice meal to be enjoyed al fresco.  One of things that makes our Norstone Rock Panels a good fit for these outdoor kitchens is that most of them feature prominent outside corners in multiple locations, including the one we are featuring today.  This is where our industry leading finger jointed corner units really shine since they create such a seamless looking corner, especially when compared to other stone veneer manufacturers that are using simple dove tail corners, sometimes leaving saw cut edges exposed.  When you work through every detail on a project like this, from the grill to the counter top to the fridge, those very prominent outside corners is a detail not to be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also really like how the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/xlx-rock-panels/aztec/&quot;&gt;Aztec color palette&lt;/a&gt; works on this project.  Particularly when used outside, and bathed in natural light as the stone is in these photos, the Aztec really comes off a good bit lighter in overall color than when used interior.  From a color standpoint, Aztec does a great job of blending in, while still giving a little bit accent color pop against the very neutral color palette the smooth stucco exterior and brick paver lanai create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/24/Aztec Stacked Stone Outdoor Feature Wall Orlando.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Aztec Stacked Stone Veneer used on an outdoor feature wall in a small screened in lanai with outdoor lounge furniture and an outdoor television&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other prominent use of the stone is in a large feature wall directly opposite the outdoor kitchen. This is a space that we really wish we had a before and after picture of – because the transformation of this space is huge!  From a simple smooth stucco wall painted the same neutral tone as the rest of the exterior of the home, to a vibrant, textured feature wall, this wall went from something you walked past on your way to the pool to the focal point of an outdoor living space that adds value to this home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/24/Aztec Stacked Stone Outdoor Living Orlando.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Aztec Stacked Stone Veneer used on the outdoor kitchen and an outdoor feature wall in a nicely designed outdoor living space opening up to a screened in pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last photo of this project encapsulates the space utilization that we mentioned above.  In a relatively small space, the homeowners have created an outdoor kitchen with a small bar area for entertaining both wet and dry guests, an outdoor dining area, and an effective outdoor living room to be enjoyed almost the entire year round in Florida.  The stone does a great job of bringing the space together horizontally from one side to the other and creating some consistency of color and texture.  And while it’s very subtle, the unique loose flagstone style pool coping does a neat job of loosely bringing the natural stone design element into the pool as well.  This is really cool, especially since you almost always see brick coping when the pool deck is brick pavers.  Details really do make the difference!&lt;/p&gt;

Size and shape, how the product gets assembled, and how the product gets installed are just some of the variables that dictate how a product ends up looking when it gets on your wall.  One of the most noticeable ways that the look of natural stone can be changed is by how its finished, and the two most common finishes in the Stone Veneer world are split face and honed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split Face generally refers to products that have either been quarried or mechanically split using machines to create a rough hewn surface that shows off the natural cleft of the stone.  Depending on the type of stone that is being worked, the end result can vary from a slightly smoother finished surface on  a more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/quartz-ledgestone-vs-countertop/&quot;&gt;quartz based stone&lt;/a&gt;, to a more inconsistent and cratered look on stones like limestone and sandstone.  Natural stone splits along the cleavage layers and most of the time it can end up being fairly flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split face finishes might tend to be associated with more traditional looking stone applications and colors, sometimes even described as “rustic”.  Traditional stone colors that have been used in building such as greys, browns, and tans are quite common when it comes to split face stone veneers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Norstone &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/stacked-stone-cladding/&quot;&gt;Standard Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/&quot;&gt;XL Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-slim-line-budget-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;Slim Line Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt; are the products in our current offering that have a split face finish.  You’ll find the traditional earth tone colors in these collections, but one of the things that we think allows these products to stand apart is some unique color offerings in split face like our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels/white/&quot;&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels/ivory/&quot;&gt; Ivory&lt;/a&gt; Panels, as well as a very design oriented approach to assembling the panels, which creates clean lines and puts a modern twist on a classic stone look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honed finishes are also an incredibly popular finish in the world of stone veneer.  Honed means that the stone itself has been cut at a gauged thickness and then polished to varying degrees of smoothness.  On the spectrum of polishing, honed normally means a very light polish, resulting in a stone surface that is smooth to the touch, but not glossy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/20/Honed Stone Veneer Modern Wall Panel in Bathroom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Honed Aksent Series Modern Stone Veneer Wall Panels in Ash Grey color used on a bathroom backsplash&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honed finishes are currently most synonymous with modern design that embraces big open spaces and smooth surfaces like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/glass-steel-stone-for-modern-homes/&quot;&gt;glass, concrete, and steel&lt;/a&gt;.  Since honed finishes are just cut and polished and not mechanically split the way split face veneers are, they tend to be available in pretty much any color that stone can be sourced in.  Honed finishes do require more labor and therefore often times are more expensive than split face veneers made from the same stone.&lt;/p&gt;

Aiming right at the modern design inspired project, the colors in these series fall mainly in the black, white, and grey range.  A new color, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/aksent-modern-tiles/beige-marble-veneer/&quot;&gt;Beige&lt;/a&gt;, was released in the Fall of 2017 in the Aksent and Lynia Series which also brings in the neutral tan colors that continue to be widely accepted in interior design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for learning more about the difference between Split Face and Honed Finishes in the world of natural stone veneer.  Probably the most important thing to remember is to keep your options open when considering projects for your next stone veneer project as you might happen upon a combination of stone color, size, pattern and most importantly finish that works just perfect for your project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">When it comes to stone veneer, the difference between split face vs honed is akin to the difference between porcelain vs ceramic tile or granite vs quartz counter tops.

The product used is our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/aksent-modern-tiles/ebony/&quot;&gt;Aksent Series panel in the Ebony color&lt;/a&gt;.  The Aksent panel is a newer product to our line up, and is a modern twist on the traditional split face stacked stone cladding panels that we’ve been making for close to 15 years.  With a honed face, blocky geometry, and  clean lines the Aksent panel leans toward modern design.  The Ebony color, which we also make in Lynia Interlocking Tiles and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/planc-new-dimension-norstone/&quot;&gt;Planc Large Format Wall Cladding&lt;/a&gt;, is the darkest stone in our line up, and as such is a very bold combination which we were excited to see used in an outdoor application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/19/Norstone Modern Stone Panel Outdoor Kitchen Grill Island.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Aksent Modern Stone Cladding in Ebony Color on an Outdoor Kitchen with large stainless steel grill&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two distinct features on this project that received the Aksent modern stone wall cladding – an “L” shaped outdoor kitchen and a square low slung fire pit.  No expense was spared on this outdoor kitchen with the stone being used on the front face as well as on the interior wall sections.  Something that is subtle to most people, but really stands out to us is how awesome the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-classroom-session-working-corners-1/&quot;&gt;finger jointed stone outside corner units&lt;/a&gt; worked in this application.  As the stone turns the outside corners as it moves from the front face to the inside face of the outdoor kitchen the look is incredibly seamless.  Kudos to the installation team on this project for a great job not only on the corners, but on the multiple cut outs along the grill, refrigerator and other stainless steel doors on the inside wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/19/Norstone Modern Stone Panel Firepit.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Aksent Modern Stone Cladding in Ebony Color on a low slung square outdoor gas firepit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire pit is also a really nice feature, and the use of the same Ebony Aksent stone really helps create a consistent design them in this space.  The low slung design of this fire pit and the fact that its a gas unit is more suited for creating a nice ambiance when the sun goes down versus putting out much heat, and is perfect for facilitating conversation over the flames.  The durability of the stone makes it a perfect choice to mesh in with the hardscape of the pool deck and stand up to years and years of feet leaning against it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned above, the Ebony color is a bold choice for any project, which was flawlessly executed here.  The dark color of the stone works matches nicely with the dark colored stone counter top and is a nice complement to the stainless steel grill and other fixtures in terms of smoothness while still contrasting color wise.  From a color standpoint, the two biggest color splashes in this project, the light natural stone of the outdoor paver deck and the dark color of the Ebony modern stone wall cladding foil each other wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you thought a light / dark stone color combination was a little boring, this project hits you with an unexpected dash of blue, both in the glass media of the fire pit……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/19/Norstone Modern Stone Panel Gas Firepit.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Aksent Modern Stone Cladding in Ebony Color on a gas firepit with bright blue glass media&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And some cool LED light strips mounted to underneath the counter tops that cast a cool blue hue across the stone.  While not every space can make bold color choices like this project has, we love when someone is willing to take the leap to design and build something that speaks to them!&lt;/p&gt;

While outdoor spaces like decks and patios have been around since the post war housing boom, the key change over the last several decade or so is really focusing on creating spaces that are comfortable and that you want to spend time in, hence the term “outdoor living”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone of all types is a great product to be used for outdoor living spaces because of its durability and natural aesthetic that fits the space.  Let’s take a look at a few ways stacked stone can be used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/exteriors/&quot;&gt;outdoor living spaces&lt;/a&gt; that will add beauty to any space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/27/Stacked Stone Fireplace in Outdoor Living Space.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre Stacked Stone used as the surround on a large outdoor fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outdoor fireplaces and fire pits are a great choice for&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/&quot;&gt; stacked stone&lt;/a&gt;.  Stacked stone looks great on fireplaces indoors and looks especially awesome on outdoor fireplaces as well where the natural stone element of the finish really shines through.  Whether you’ve got a lot of open space for a large fire pit surrounded by stacked stone, or a small corner with a wood or gas burning unit, fire places add ambiance to any setting and a great addition to an outdoor living space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/27/Stacked Stone Outdoor Kitchen in Outdoor Living Space.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ivory Rock Panels used in a large outdoor kitchen with pizza oven&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living outdoors wouldn’t be complete with food, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stacked-stone-outdoor-kitchen/&quot;&gt;outdoor kitchens&lt;/a&gt; make up our next option for how stacked stone can be used in outdoor living spaces.  With outdoor kitchens ranging the gamut from something as simple as a grill and a sink to kitchens that put most home kitchens to shame, complete with refrigeration, dishwashers and even fancy add ons like pizza ovens, these spaces offer many unique opportunities to use stacked stone.  Depending on the configuration, back splashes are a common use for stacked stone, as is the face or sometimes the entire base of grill islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/27/Stacked Stone Water Feature in Outdoor Living Space.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal Rock Panels used on the spillway of a large outdoor water feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water Features are another awesome way to use stacked stone in an exterior space.  Stacked stone water features like the one seen here are great because they not only are always very visually appealing, they also create sound which excites another sense and adds to the overall desirability of the outdoor living space.  Many years ago we actually used to make a portable water feature unit that was about two feet wide and 5 feet tall that was ideal for balconies, so no matter how small the space, there’s always a way to add some ambiance with stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/27/Stacked Stone Feature Wall in Outdoor Living Space.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal Rock Panels used as a feature wall in a modern designed outdoor space with reflecting pond&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a well placed stone feature wall is always a great way to enhance an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/natural-stone-patios-designing-norstone-series/&quot;&gt;outdoor living space&lt;/a&gt;.  Whether the stacked stone wall is being used for its color, texture, or placement, it affords the space the opportunity to create a focal point and add to or reinforce the other design elements.  We especially love the Charcoal feature wall shown here as it subtly does so many things.  From a color standpoint, the dark grey of the Charcoal contrasts nicely with the smooth stucco walls while at the same time complementing the dark teak flooring and vibrant greenery.  From a texture standpoint, the stone is designed to contrast the smooth surfaces surrounding it, including the walls, flooring, sheet glass water feature and even the smooth pebble borders around the walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve already got an outdoor living space and are looking to add a cool feature like stacked stone to take it to the next level, or if you are staring at a blank space in your backyard and just starting to consider the possibilities, I urge you to spend some time looking at our photo galleries of exterior stone projects for inspiration.  The outdoors is always calling, so answer it this summer with stacked stone!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">Outdoor living spaces are a booming trend in home design.

This space has some very interesting stone design elements to it, including the vertical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/installing-norstone-vertical-orientation/&quot;&gt;installation of the stone panels&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a unique take on how to use stacked stone panels on a column.  Come with us on a quick tour around this unique space to see what it makes it so cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the space itself is concerned, the term “loft” when used to describe a multifamily apartment or condo building has become overused over the past several years.  The fundamental design it tries to convey is a large open space with great natural light, high ceilings, that are typically on one floor of a multi level building.  The original “loft” style buildings were re-purposed factories and industrial buildings in cities like New York, that were often in less desirable neighborhoods with lower rents that attracted artists that popularized the open concept design.  Today, many new construction buildings are designed along these same ideals, maximizing ceiling height, open space and natural light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/26/Norstone White Stacked Stone Panels Condo Loft Column Vertical Installation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Rock Panels installed vertically on a column in a modern themed condo set against a kitchen with dark cabinets and brown concrete stained floors&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that catches our eye on this installation is the modern color pallete.  The white stone feature walls flanking the entry foyer combined with the freshly painted white walls dominate the space, adding to the already open and bright feel.  What we really like though is the English leather brown color of the stained concrete floors. While the design team opted for lots of black accents throughout the space, including the baseboards, cabinets and doors, a darker colored floor would really amp up the modern feel of the space and start to limit potential resale value.  In addition to reinforcing the light colors of the design scheme, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels/white/&quot;&gt;White Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt; also are a great contrast in texture as compared to the smoothness of the rest of the finishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/26/Norstone White Stacked Stone Panels Condo Loft Feature Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Rock Panels on two feature walls flanking the entryway in a modern designed condo loft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vertically installing the stone panels is another very unique aspect of this project.  A vertical installation, where the 24” side of our rock panels are run vertically, accentuates the height of any space and also lends itself towards a more modern look. Furniture that is low to the ground and the large art piece that is resting on the floor keep your eyes towards the ground which also helps make the ceilings feel taller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/26/Norstone White Stacked Stone Panels Condo Loft Feature Wall with Downlighting.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Rock Panels installed vertically with downlighting to accentuate ceiling height and the texture of the stone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked before about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;how lighting is an important part of a stone installation&lt;/a&gt;, and were very happy to see the overheard recessed light strips on the two main stone feature walls of this space.  The White Rock Panels, because of their color, can look a fair bit different depending on the type of light being cast on them.  The ultra pure white LED down lighting used in this installation does a great job of creating a dramatic effect and highlighting the texture of the stone feature wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/26/Norstone White Stacked Stone Panels Condo Loft Feature Wall and Column Showing Texture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Rock Panels installed vertically on a column leaving the long edge open on the outside corners for a modern look&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last thing that catches our eye on this project is the super unique way the design and installation team decided to wrap the interior column.  Our stone veneer corner units are designed to be installed with a traditional horizontal orientation, so in keeping with the vertical orientation of the feature wall, the rock panels were installed on the column leaving the long cut edge of the panel exposed at the corner.  The drawback of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stone-veneer-columns-norstone-classroom-series/&quot;&gt;installing stone on a column&lt;/a&gt; like this is that it doesn’t “hide” the fact that the stone used on the walls and column is a veneer as opposed to a full bed stone, however it does give the column a very modern clean lined look which does fit nicely with the rest of the design cues of the space.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, throughout the 1980s, 90s, and early 2000s one of the biggest changes in the tile industry was tile sizes getting larger and larger.  12X12s gave way to 18x18s, 24x24s, 36x36s and so on.  Innovative companies are keeping the quest for bigger being better alive and well with precision manufactured porcelain products that can be sized up to 1 meter x 3 meters while only being a few millimeters thick, creating a covering that is tile but behaves almost like a skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/21/Increasing Tile Sizes Through The Year.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo showing increasing sizes in tile throughout the years&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tile industry has now embraced shape and patterns as equal cornerstones of good design and we’re seeing rectangles and planks as well as patterns that range from traditional herringbone and parquets to intricate multi size and shape tile patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something we’re very proud of is our recently released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;PLANC large format wall tile collection&lt;/a&gt;.  As floor tile was getting bigger, wall tile was staying relatively small, with mosaics dominating the design trends on areas like kitchen backsplashes.  We set out to prove that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/planc-new-dimension-norstone/&quot;&gt;large format tiles&lt;/a&gt; have a place in any wall tile project, and this cozy corner kitchen backsplash is a perfect example of how a large format tile can work nicely in a small space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/21/Norstone Planc Platinum  Large Format Tile Kitchen Backsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Planc tiles in platinum on a dodern kitchen with white countertops, white cabinets, and a small island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a scaling standpoint, each of the Plancs on this backsplash are 31.5” long, and come in three heights (5.5”, 3.1”, and 2.4”).  Like most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/backsplash-tile-designs-norstone-industy-series/&quot;&gt;current kitchen backsplashes&lt;/a&gt;, this one has about 18” of wall space between the top of the countertop and bottom of the upper cabinet, which a you can see in the head on photo of the sink, allows for about six courses of the Planc stone to be set.  The courses in this installation were set in a random staggered pattern, creating a pattern that complements the different heights and creates a lot of visual interest in this small space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/21/Norstone Large Format Tile Planc Kitchen Backsplash Platinum Color.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Straight on look at Norstone PLANC tile used in a small kitchen backsplash showing the pattern and coursing of the tile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a color standpoint, the grey color pallete of the Platinum is extremely appealing to modern design.  This kitchen, with its white marble counter tops and white cabinets creates a great contrasting look with the neutral grey tones.  But what makes this product really appealing is the amazing surface characteristics that make it unmistakable that this is a natural stone.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/lava-stone-rocks/&quot;&gt;Lava Stone&lt;/a&gt; that this product is made from ranges from a smooth saw cut finish with tight graining to consistently honeycombed appearance with lots of surface divots.  What we actually love the most though is the occasional vein of honeycombing that shows up every now and then giving the product a natural stone look that just can’t be beat.  An installer with a keen eye, like the team that worked on this project, can use these veins to their advantage by lining up the veins from one course to the next for a true handcrafted look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last thing we love about this project is the great use of natural light in the space.  The open concept of the space brings in natural light from every angle, but especially the prominent window in the corner.  Natural light brings out the best in everything in the space, color, texture, and scale wise, making sure the large Planc tiles on the backsplash don’t feel too dark and big for the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking a look at this cool project with us and seeing how a large format tile like Norstone PLANC can work in even the smallest of spaces.  In addition to interiors, most colors in the PLANC collection can be used exterior and in water applications as well making this one of the most versatile &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;natural stone products&lt;/a&gt; in our line up.

With the heat of the summer bearing down on us interior projects offer a respite from the heat outside and since many interior renovation projects are smaller in nature, they also can be easier to fit in while juggling holidays and vacations.  So this week we decided to pay homage to summer and compile a list of 5 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/interiors/&quot;&gt;interior stacked stone projects&lt;/a&gt; you might consider to make a big impact on your space without a big commitment of time or money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/21/Norstone White Rock Panel Entryway.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Stacked Stone White Rock Panels used in the entryway of an upscale loft condo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to spiff up your home, a good place to start is the entryway or foyer.  It’s what you and your guests see and experience every time the threshold is crossed and is a good opportunity to set the tone for your home.  A few years ago a customer in Minnesota was working on a loft condo and used our White Rock Panels to flank the front door on both sides.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/installing-norstone-vertical-orientation/&quot;&gt;stone was installed in a vertical orientation&lt;/a&gt; and has some great spot lighting that really accentuates the color and texture the stone provides.  The pure white color complements the modern minimalist design aesthetic of the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/21/Norstone Ochre Stacked Stone Powder Room Feature Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Stacked Stone Ochre Rock Panel Feature Wall in a Powder Bath&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Powder rooms are another great small summertime project.  Since the space is generally pretty small to begin with you can make a big impact with a small amount of stone on the wall.  A few things to consider with powder rooms is the plumbing attachments and how the vanity and mirror will be attached to the wall.  Lighting is also important in small spaces like powder rooms, so consider lighter color stones like White and Ivory if good natural light or sufficient artificial lights isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/21/Norstone Charcoal Stacked Stone Backsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Stacked Stone Charcoal Rock Panels on a modern backsplash with a glass splatter guard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/backsplash/&quot;&gt;Kitchen backsplashes&lt;/a&gt; are probably the small tiling project most people think of.  As we’ve seen before, stacked stone rock panels are a unique option for an outside the box backsplash.  Whether the design scheme is mountain rustic using Ochre Blend color, or a more contemporary look like the Charcoal backsplash seen here, stacked stone not only serves as a very durable backsplash material, but also one that will have you and your guests talking about for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/21/Norstone White Stacked Stone Stairway Installation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Stacked Stone White Rock Panels run vertically on stair case&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stair Landings are usually one of the most uninspiring areas of a home, serving more as a way to get people from one place to the other and not really a place people care too much about.  The reality though is that stairs are often centrally located in homes and with the prevalence of high ceilings in today’s new construction stair landings and stair ways are more in view than ever.  The height alone makes this type of project one of the harder ones on our list, but as you can see adding stacked stone to a staircase or stair landing can make a huge impact on the space.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;Lighting is probably the most important consideration&lt;/a&gt; for a tall project like a stairway – after all you want to make sure you can see what’s on the wall!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/06/21/Norstone Ochre Stacked Stone Bar Project.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Stacked Stone Ochre Rock Panels used for accents on a basement bar&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least is some people’s favorite spot in their entire home, that being the bar, that completes our list of interior stacked stone projects to tackle this summer.  Whether your bar has enough room for you and the rest of the football team in your basement or man cave, or just a simple wet bar in the corner of the kitchen, adding a stacked stone accent wall or mini backsplash can really elevate the space without a huge time or financial commitment to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope these projects inspire you to beat the heat this summer and look around your home for a small interior project you can tackle.  Before we know it the evenings will start to get just a little fresher, the leaves will get some color, but until then you friends at Norstone urge you to stay cool and think stone during the Summer of 2018!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">If the heat of the summer has got you dreading stepping outside the A/C these 5 interior stacked stone projects might help you beat the heat and make your house more beautiful at the same time!</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.norstoneusa.com/%7B%22src%22=%3E%22/uploads/2018/06/21/Norstone%20Ochre%20Stacked%20Stone%20Powder%20Room%20Feature%20Wall.jpg%22,%20%22title%22=%3E%22Interior%20Stacked%20Stone%20Projects%22,%20%22alt%22=%3E%22Small%20Powder%20Room%20with%20a%20stacked%20stone%20feature%20wall%22%7D" /></entry></feed>
