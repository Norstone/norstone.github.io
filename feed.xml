This master bath renovation project took the natural stone design scheme and ran with it all the way to the goal line.  Beautiful flooring and an amazing textured wall of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;Norstone Ochre XL Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt; all lead up to the real show stopper, which is the amazing free standing one-piece natural stone tub.  Let’s take a look at all of those things and the awesome details that make this space noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/04/Stacked Stone Bathroom Feature Wall with Freestanding Tub.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre XL Feature Wall in a bathroom feauturing a freestanding one piece natural stone tub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flooring has always been a primary use for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/natural-stone-bathrooms-designing-norstone-series/&quot;&gt;natural stone in high end bathrooms&lt;/a&gt;.  We don’t have a ton of detail about the flooring used in this project, but visually we can tell its a large format tile that is either natural stone, or a high end porcelain version that uses HD printing and other technologies to very closely mimic the look of natural stone.  In recent years, porcelain tile manufacturing has gotten so good that its almost impossible to tell from pictures alone whether a product is natural stone or manufactured tile.  Regardless, the floor tile in this bathroom sets the color tone for the entire space which the tub, accent wall, and all other design elements work off of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stacked stone feature wall stands out from both a color and texture standpoint.  While still working within the base “earth tones” of the space, the Ochre XL Rock Panels also bring in a nice blend of accent colors, including some darker charcoals that work with the storage unit and inside of the tub, as well as some lighter brown and orange accents that complement the exposed wood beam on the ceiling.  The texture the wall creates is super important to the overall feel of the space, complementing the freestanding natural hewn tub.  The height of the room and the decision to go floor to ceiling with the stone helps give this feature wall an added visual impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/10/04/Stacked Stone Bathroom Feature Wall with Vintage Tub Hardware.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre XL Stacked Stone on a bathroom feature wall showing a close up of vintage tub hardware&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small detail not to be missed is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;light fixture on the stone wall&lt;/a&gt;.  Positioned to illuminate the tub hardware and provide some low level ambient lighting to enjoy both a soak and a good book, this light fixture also does a great job of blending into the wall and not detracting from the stone feature wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving the best for last, the tub itself is really the focus of the space and in and of itself an incredibly unique design element.  One piece stone stubs are kind of like the Rolls Royce of bathrooms and you most often see them made from marble.  What is really cool about this particular tub is that the stone its made from has a very unique looking natural cleft to the outside of it as well as the overall shape of the tub.  To truly appreciate natural stone, you have to learn to appreciate the imperfections in nature and how those manifest themselves in finished products.  The asymmetrical nature of this tub really hits home that the beauty is in the imperfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside the box design ideas aren’t for everyone when it comes to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/showers/&quot;&gt;bathroom design&lt;/a&gt; or remodel project, but they sure are fun to look and dream about for your own space.

For the sake of defining what cold weather is, we’ll peg it as the ambient temperate of the installation being below 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  Let’s dig into this topic and learn more about why it’s important to know about the cold weather installation procedures and what your options are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/26/Stacked Stone Veneer Cold Weather Install in the Fall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Installed on Columns in a Lake House in Wisconsin in the Fall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand more about why stone can’t be set below 40 degrees Fahrenheit you actually need to understand the properties of the mortar or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-different-types-of-thinset-and-what-s-the-best-thinset-for-stacked-stone-installations/&quot;&gt;thin set that’s being used to install the stone veneer&lt;/a&gt;, not the stone itself.  The mortar is critically important because of the water content – which in an average / room temperature installation allows the setting material to cure along a prescribed time line, slowly drying out while allowing the other natural and chemical agents to fully cure and create a very strong bond with the stone.  A cold weather installation, particularly one where the temperature can drop below 40 degrees Fahrenheit at any point, night or day, during a 7 day window after installation, risks freezing the moisture content in the setting material and stalling / stopping the curing process, resulting in a bond strength between stone and wall that might not be sufficient to hold the stone over the long run of an average installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you probably know, and maybe even the reason why you’re reading this article, construction time lines don’t always work out the way they were originally planned.  Sometimes you might find yourself staring down the barrel of a project that needs to be completed, but has complicating factors like an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/exteriors/&quot;&gt;outdoor installation of stone veneer&lt;/a&gt; in the Fall or Winter.  As is the case with many things in life, prevention is the best solution in this situation.  Often times a project manager can get creative and have weather sensitive materials installed out of the traditional sequence, but before the cold weather sets in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/26/Stone Veneer Installed in Cold Weather Climate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Installed in a cold weather climate with snow on the ground&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a creative solution to get the stone veneer installed before the cold weather hits isn’t in the cards, the two main options we advise our clients on is first to see if there’s any possibility they can find a 7 day period to get this material installed and cured without dipping below that 40 degree mark.  While this requires a little more flexibility, this is an effective technique which ends up requiring a lot less work than other alternatives, and can be good for areas that only on occasion get cold weather, or in the early or late parts of the cold weather season where they might be able to find a good 7 day window to work in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the project is in an area, or a time of year, where the 40 degree mark is going to be consistently broken, then tenting the installation and using an artificial heat source to maintain temperature is the option of choice.  The main thing to be aware and mindful of with a tented installation is the safe and continuous operation of the heat source.  Safety should always be the highest priority on any job site, so the proper precautions should definitely be taken to ensure the heat source creates no other problems on the job site including ventilation.  And seeing as though the heat source will most often need run at night, when the temperate is the lowest and coincidentally when nobody is there, it also makes sense to have the proper monitoring system in place to ensure the heat source is working.  A wifi enabled thermometer that can be checked remotely or send out alerts if the temperature falls below a certain point is a good investment for a stone veneer installation that needs tented because of cold weather.  When interviewing or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/hiring-a-contractor-for-your-next-stone-project/&quot;&gt;hiring a contractor to install stone veneer&lt;/a&gt;, be sure to ask them for a detailed cold weather plan if it’s that time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/26/Stacked Stone Installation Tented for Cold Weather.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Installation that has been tented using scaffolding and a heat source to allow for a cold weather installation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking to yourself that having to tent a stone veneer installation to install in weather under 40 degrees sounds like a pain in the but – you’re absolutely right, it is!  But rest assured that it is important – several years ago we worked with a contractor that installed our stone veneer panels on the exterior of a home in Northern New Jersey in January, literally while there was still snow on the ground!  Fast forward to the end of the next summer, the stone literally started to fall off the wall and ended up getting torn down and replaced.  So while it might not be fun, tenting and maintaining temperatures above 40 degrees is important for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/how-to-install-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;successful stone veneer installation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

To the uninitiated, rustic brings up the idea that something is old and worn down, still functional, but clearly lacking that brand new feeling.  Most designers these days are throwing the term “rustic” around these days to describe a space that mainly chooses finishes and materials that are representative of finishes and materials of yesteryear, but in reality are all brand new, high quality stuff that’s just designed to capture the plain and sometimes partially unfinished feel of something “rustic”.  Some designers have even gone so far to start calling it “modern rustic”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beautiful project in the woods of Wisconsin, not too far from Milwaukee, is a great example of the “modern rustic” look.  This is a new build that has been meticulously designed and curated with materials and finishes that evoke the true look and sense of a old cabin, including our personal favorite, a knockout &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/backsplash/&quot;&gt;stacked stone backsplash&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/19/Norstone Ochre Rock Panels on Rustic Kitchen Backsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre Blend Rock Panels on a Rustic Kitchen Backsplash with a large butcher block island and a ceiling with exposed natural log beams&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;stacked stone rock panels in the Ochre Blend color&lt;/a&gt; have been installed on the backsplash of this rustic kitchen and do an amazing job of complementing the design scheme of the space.  The color palette, and how well the Ochre color fits in with the rest of the materials,  is one of the first things that sticks out the most to me on this project.  The space is dominated by the medium brown tones of the cabinetry and the exposed natural log beams on the ceiling.  The dark stone counter top and the drop dead gorgeous dark brown butcher block island give some dimension to the brown tones as well.  The Ochre Blend color, which is generally made up of about 40% brown tones, 40% charcoal or gray tones, and about 20% accent colors, including the oranges, blues, greens, pinks,etc does a great job of fitting within the palette while still creating some noticeable contrast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/19/Norstone Ochre Rock Panels on Rustic Kitchen Backsplash With Exposed Natural Log Beam Ceiling.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre Blend Rock Panels on a Rustic Kitchen Backsplash featuring prominent exposed natural log beams on the ceiling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/backsplash-tile-designs-norstone-industy-series/&quot;&gt;trend of using a stacked stone backsplash&lt;/a&gt; on this rustic inspired kitchen is really cool, there’s no doubt in our minds that most people when entering this space for the first time are going to have their eyes immediately drawn upward by the amazing ceiling.  The base ceiling is beautiful tongue and groove pine slats that form a nice backdrop for the real stars of the space, which are the exposed natural log beams.  The natural log beams and the stacked stone on the backsplash form a unique texture bridge, being really the only finishes in the space which show the natural texture of the products they are made from – whether that’s the natural split face of the stone, or the knot holes, branch nodes, or any other imperfections shown in the beams.  In the whole “rustic” design theme, this is incredibly important because it gives the space credibility and an inherent “naturalness” that’s a key component of the desired look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/19/Norstone Ochre Rock Panels on Rustic Kitchen Backsplash with Island.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre Blend Rock Panels on a Rustic Kitchen Backsplash with a large butcher block island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days, kitchen islands are a dime a dozen, so it’s not too often that one stands out like this one.  In the above photo, our eyes are immediately drawn to the thickness of the butcher block style counter top, giving the space a very bold, and you guessed it, rustic look.  Everything else in this space, whether it’s the ceiling, the cabinetry, or the rustic stacked stone backsplash gets put up against this island and helps complete the design theme.  Specifically as it relates to the rustic backsplash, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/large-format-tile-small-kitchen-backsplash/&quot;&gt;the larger format of the stacked stone panel on the backsplash&lt;/a&gt;, especially as compared to more standard backsplash tiles like sheet mosaics, proves to be a good choice for a kitchen design where the clients haven’t backed down anywhere from going full scale, whether that’s with the exposed natural log beams or the thick butcher block island.&lt;/p&gt;

You might call a product field stone in Tennessee and flag stone in California, or stacked stone in Florida and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/split-face-stone-norstone-industry-series/&quot;&gt;split face&lt;/a&gt; in New York.  One such grouping of terms that is generally misunderstood is Basalt and Lava Stone, when used to refer to the same stone.  Here at Norstone we’ve been working with Basalt for about 10 years, and even with all that knowledge, we’ll readily admit that we didn’t really know what the difference was until about 18 months ago when we first started prototyping new products made from what our quarry was calling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/lava-stone-rocks/&quot;&gt;Lava Stone&lt;/a&gt;.  The old saying that you learn something new every day rang true for us that day when we learned what the difference is between Basalt and Lava Stone.  Let’s take a deep dive into these two stones and learn how they are both similar and different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll go ahead and start with Basalt, since this is a stone that we’ve worked with for many years, and define it, at a very high level, as an igneous rock that is formed from the rapid cooling of lava at or very near the surface.  One of the key things to know about basalt is that it has a fine grained mineral texture which is formed because the molten lava is cooling so quickly that it doesn’t have time to form for large mineral crystals to grow.  Basalt is generally going to be in the grey to dark grey to black color range since its formed from molten lava.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basalt is a very workable stone that can be cut thin, has suitable hardness and durability for a variety of commercial applications, and can be honed, polished, or finished in a variety of other ways to create interesting products.  Norstone makes a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;medium format interlocking wall tile&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/aksent-modern-tiles/&quot;&gt;3D smooth faced stone panel&lt;/a&gt;, and our large format loose veneer Planc product with basalt in two different colors, Grey and Ebony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lava Stone is a more generic term than Basalt from a geological standpoint.  Most of the time it’s used in the stone industry to describe any stone that is a volcanic rock, which in reality can vary widely based on the mineral content of the volcanic rock itself.  The Lava Stone that we are using in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;wall veneer products&lt;/a&gt; has a very similar make up to basalt from a mineral composition standpoint, the main difference is that the Lava Stone has varying degrees of vesicles, or what we simply refer to as “holes”.  These vesicles form when gases that were dissolved in the molten magma come out of the solution during eruption, creating bubbles in the molten rock, some of which get frozen in place as the rock cools and becomes solid, creating the unique veining and natural stone “marking” that we see in our lava stone products.  This stone generally cools less rapidly than basalt, making the grain not quite as fine and not as dense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lava Stone is also a great product for commercial applications and has a distinct advantage of being more cost effective than basalt since it is more prevalent and the natural features, such as heavy vesicle patterns or veining, are considered part of the natural beauty of the stone and not an imperfection as it would be for basalt.  Norstone currently only makes two products with Lava Stone, our Platinum and Graphite colors of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/planc-new-dimension-norstone/&quot;&gt;large format loose veneer Planc tile&lt;/a&gt;.  Platinum has a basic saw cut finish while Graphite has a light honing to create a smoother texture and slightly darker color.  We see a lot of possibility with Lava Stone and are testing it for other products including our Lynia Interlocking Tiles and Aksent 3D Stone Panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to natural stone, it’s super important to know what kind of stone you are working with, as it can impact where it can be used (interior / exterior / water applications, etc), and how the product should be maintained.  If the manufacturer of a stone product can be specific with the details of a stone being used it’s a red flag that they don’t really know what they’re working with and that might mean potential pit falls for you down the road if the information they provide turns out to be incompatible with the actual stone being used.

In most places the weather is still perfect for spending time outdoors and really enjoying it since the days start to get shorter quickly and depending on where you live, the tell tale signs of Fall show up before you know it.  For many of us, the backyard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/pools/&quot;&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt; is top choice for a relaxing Labor Day weekend, so in this week’s project profile we’re taking a look at a really cool installation a customer of ours did a few years ago in Southern California where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/ivory/&quot;&gt;Ivory Rock Panel&lt;/a&gt; was used prominently on a number of features on the pool, spa, and outdoor kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/05/Norstone Ivory Rock Panels Stacked Stone Raised Beam Pool Feature.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Veneer used on a raised beam feature in a modern styled pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first up close photo taken from one side of the pool and looking out towards the mountain view of this hillside home shows the Ivory Rock Panel used as stone cladding on a raised beam water feature on two sides of the pool.  Raised beams are incredibly popular in current pool design as they allow you to incorporate a wider variety of products into the installation, such as the stacked stone we see here, can be used to create privacy, and also are perfect for housing water falls and scuppers, as well as providing a place to position fire bowls and other exciting pool features.  One of the cool things about our Ivory Rock Panel is that since its made from hard &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/quartz-ledgestone-vs-countertop/&quot;&gt;natural quartz stone&lt;/a&gt;, it can not only be used in and around water, but it can even be used as a waterline tile and be submerged, as its shown here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/05/Norstone Ivory Rock Panels Stacked Stone Outside Corner Unit.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Finger Joint Corner Units shown in Ivory covering two outside corners on an exterior landscape wall with Travertine Cap&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what type of outside corner you have, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/miter-cut-vs-corner-unit/&quot;&gt;Norstone Interlocking Finger Joint Corner&lt;/a&gt; is going to deliver a fantastic looking corner that’s super easy to install.  This particular area shows two outside corners and how two separate corner units can be used relatively close together and still produce a wonderful looking corner situation without noticeable seams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that catches our eye on this last photo is the travertine cap used on the raised beam of the pool.  Travertine is a very versatile product and, as you can see here, blends remarkably well with the light cream, yellow and gold tones of the Ivory Rock Panel, making travertine a great product to complement the stone with in all sorts of applications including hearths, sills, treads, and caps!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/05/Norstone Ivory Rock Panels Stacked Stone Curved Spa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Veneer panels used on the curved walls of a raised spa&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the common misconceptions about stone veneer panel systems is that they can’t be used on curved walls.  The truth is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-install-stacked-stone-on-curved-walls/&quot;&gt;stone panel systems can be used on curved walls&lt;/a&gt;, you just have to work within certain limitations on the radius, or “curve” of the wall, or you might need to alter the panel itself to make it more adaptable to a tighter radius application.  This beautiful installation on both the convex and concave sides of a spa is so well done it’s even hard for our team to pick out the panel seams in this photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/09/05/Norstone Ivory Rock Panels Stacked Stone Outdoor Kitchen.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Stacked Stone Veneer used on an outdoor kitchen with pizza kitchen and low profile stone backsplash&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beautiful outdoor kitchen is the crowning achievement of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stacked-stone-for-outdoor-living/&quot;&gt;stacked stone backyard oasis&lt;/a&gt;, complete with a stacked stone pizza oven and low profile stacked stone backsplash.  Upping the “livability” of this outdoor space to include a small refrigerator, prep sink, and multiple cooking apparatuses, this space offers everything you need in an outdoor kitchen and is done in a very stylish way that creates continuity through the stacked stone and other materials used throughout the pool and backyard areas.&lt;/p&gt;

From the original stone walls that were made out of stones collected from clearing fields for farming to modern applications where we see stacked stone used to enhance the design of commercial and residential spaces alike, stacked stone is both practical and beautiful.  Installing this look has been the trade of stone masons across the world for centuries until recently when &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/&quot;&gt;thin stone veneer panel systems&lt;/a&gt; came onto the scene as an alternative that offered a simpler installation.  These thin stone veneer panel systems can be installed more cost effectively for a variety of reasons making the look of stacked stone available to a much wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/29/Hand Stacked Loose Stone Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Loose stone hand stacked in a traditional technique to create a stone property dividing wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental difference between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-industry-series-what-is-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;traditional hand stacked stone&lt;/a&gt; and a panel system comes down to one key difference – how each product is installed.  Hand stacked stone is generally thicker and comes as loose material, requiring the skill of a stone mason to select, hand fit, and then set each individual stone in place.  This process is time consuming and takes a specialized skill, which ultimately means hand stacking loose stone is an expensive endeavor.  Panel systems came onto the scene approximately 10-15 years ago offering a product where the stones were cut thin  and then adhered together into a uniform “tile-like” shape.  These products could be installed at high rates of speed, more similar to tile than stone, and give the wall a unique modern looking stacked stone look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/29/Thin Stone Veneer Panel System Installation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thin stone veneer panel system units being installed on a wall using thinset&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of saving money by using thin stone veneer panel systems vs traditional hand stacked stone, the biggest area of savings is in the installation.  In all likelihood, the cost of a stone panel system is going to be significantly more than the cost of loose stone – after all the stone in a panel system has been cut thin, glued and assembled into panels, and then packaged.  However, the ability to use a lower cost tile setter for the installation vs a skilled stone mason should result in a much lower installed cost per sq ft.  In fact, many homeowners have even taken on installing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-diy-infographic/&quot;&gt;thin stone veneer panel systems as a DIY project&lt;/a&gt; and had great success doing it, dramatically decreasing the cost of a project and making this look possible for all levels of material budgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thin stone veneer panel systems also affords the consumer a variety of options that simply aren’t available with traditional hand stacked stone.  Because the panel systems are made from stone that has been split or cut at a very thin dimension, nearly any natural stone can be used so long as it can be cut down to size.  Traditional hand stacked stone generally relies on stone that comes direct from quarries in certain sizes and with certain dimensions, reducing the overall variety, including color selection, of stone available.  Thin stone veneer panel systems can even introduce completely different product types to the mix, such as faux stone made from a variety of materials, or natural stone that is finished in other ways besides the traditional split face look.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/aksent-modern-tiles/&quot;&gt;Norstone’s Aksent Series Smooth Stone Veneer Panels&lt;/a&gt; are a great example of a panel system product that uses stone with a honed finish to create a tight, dry stack look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One word of caution on thin stone veneer panel systems is that not all of them are created equal.  Not only should the raw stone be evaluated, but the manufacturing of the panel also plays a big role in the overall performance of the product.  The two biggest factors in manufacturing are calibration, which ensures that the panels can be dry stacked and fit together tightly.  The tighter the panels fit without gapping, the more realistic the panel system looks.  Component parts of the panel system such as the glue or epoxy that is used to keep the individual stones together is also important as it helps stabilize and keep the panel intact during transit, cutting, and installation.  The old adage of getting what you pay for is certainly true when dealing with any sort of tile or stone product – look for higher quality products that are calibrated and manufactured well that will be easier to install and look better on your project!&lt;/p&gt;

A couple years ago we were excited to hear about a project in Minnesota at the iconic Mall of America that was planning on on using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/&quot;&gt;XL Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;.  Working through our long time partner and distributor in the Midwest, we supplied this project with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/xlx-rock-panels/charcoal/&quot;&gt;Charcoal XL color&lt;/a&gt;.  Recently, a few members of our team got a chance to see the finished project in person which we’d like to share with our readers today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/21/Norstone Charcoal XL Large Stone Veneer Mall of America JW Marriott.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal XL Large Stone Veneer used on Ground Floor of JW Marriott at Mall of America in Minnesota&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mall of America is obviously pretty massive, but our stone is easy to find as it was part of the recent expansion which included the construction of a new J.W. Marriott luxury hotel.  All of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/charcoal/&quot;&gt;Charcoal XL Stone Panels&lt;/a&gt; are used on the exterior of the building and the bulk of the stone is used on the ground level exterior around the hotel and a connected parking garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/21/Norstone Charcoal XL Large Stone Veneer Mall of America Parking Garage-1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal XL Large Stone Veneer used at Parking Garage entrance at Mall of America in Minnesota&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing we love about this project the most is that it’s a great fit for the XL Series Panel.  In fact, this is exactly the kind of project we had in mind when designing the XL Series – a project where the scale is so large that our Standard Series Rock Panels would create a very “busy” stone look.  The super-sized nature of the individual stones in the XL Series work well to create a clean, modern look that’s not overly complicated.  Malls in general are over-sized, but especially the Mall of America, which at one time was the largest mall in the country.  The attached photo shows some of that scale on a wall bordering the entrance / exit to the parking garage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/21/Norstone Charcoal XL Large Stone Veneer Mall of America Outside Corner.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal XL Large Stone Veneer with interlocking finger joint outside corners used at Mall of America in Minnesota&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/miter-cut-vs-corner-unit/&quot;&gt;interlocking finger jointed outside corner units&lt;/a&gt; are another reason that Architects and Designers love our products – it makes their jobs a lot easier!  The outside corner in this photo is the perfect example of what makes our corner units special, which come as a two piece set and interlock together to form a 90 degree outside corner.  The interlocking finger joint concept creates a relatively smooth transition from one side of the corner to the other and gives the corner a great finished look.  The Architect or Designer doesn’t have to worry about the quality of workmanship the on site contractor might deliver if they instead had chosen to specify a miter cut, and they don’t have to bring in a third party product, such as a metal tile edge or similar to finish off the corner.  Our line of accessories which includes the corners and our recently added natural end panels help solve problems for architects, designers, contractors, and homeowners that are designing, working with and installing our products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/21/Norstone Charcoal XL Large Stone Veneer Drying.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal XL Large Stone Veneer used for a modern look at Mall of America in Minnesota&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also really liking the fact that the design team on this project opted to go with natural stone.  Even though its limited to the ground floor, the inherent beauty of a natural stone product goes a long way in establishing the brand identity of this luxury hotel.  The photo above offers a nice contrast showing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/glass-steel-stone-for-modern-homes/&quot;&gt;luxurious finishes of glass, steel, and dark colored stone&lt;/a&gt; in the foreground compared to a dated building the background of beige toned brick and stucco.  The stone, shown here after some precipitation, really comes alive as it dries out going from almost black when fully wet to its native Charcoal color.&lt;/p&gt;

Many years ago I was fortunate enough to attend a class on the topic of project LEED certification and accreditation for continuing education credits at a trade show and learned a lot about this topic.  The trade show was geared towards floor and wall coverings and such the information had a decided bent towards our industry, but I still did take away some great information to assist and guide our clients that are interested in knowing how &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/stacked-stone-cladding/&quot;&gt;stacked stone veneer&lt;/a&gt; can qualify for LEED credits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give a quick baseline understanding of what we’re talking about – LEED credits are credits or points that a construction project can earn a variety of ways, from what kind of products are used, how the construction process is managed and how ongoing building functions are designed just to name a few.  And in greatly simplifying the actual process, these credits are documented, presented to the US Green Building Council, and the project can be certified along a range of levels from simply being “certified” up the “platinum”.  While the idea of creating buildings that have less environmental impact would hopefully appeal to most everyone, developers might also be able to trade off certain impact fees or expedite a zoning or permitting process by proposing a LEED certified building.  In many areas, LEED certified&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/ebony-3d-panels-commercial-storefront/&quot;&gt; commercial projects&lt;/a&gt; will lease or sell at a premium to standard build outs.  Many large multi-national companies have also begun to institute policies where their new construction projects must achieve a certain LEED designation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/20/Stacked Stone Veneer Installation on Commercial LEED Certified Project-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre Rock Panel Stone Veneer and Grey Aksent 3D Panel used on a LEED certified retail shopping project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to stacked stone veneer qualifying for or helping contribute to LEED credits, the biggest hurdle or industry faces is for the product to qualify it must be quarried and manufactured within 500 miles of the project.  This requirement is designed to minimize the emissions associated with the transportation of construction materials, but since we quarry and manufacture all of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;Norstone Natural Stone Veneer products&lt;/a&gt; in Southeast Asia, unfortunately the product credits are unattainable.  And while there are amazing stone regions in the United States, the reality is that in a country as big as this, 500 miles gets eaten up quickly.  So while that Pennsylvania Blue stone is beautiful, it’s not going to help your project in Texas.  The same goes for Texas Limestone, Wisconsin Granite, and Vermont Marble – all world class stone products made right here in the U.S., but if you fall outside that 500 mile radius of the quarry LEED product credits aren’t in your project’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/20/Stacked Stone Veneer Installation for LEED Credits.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Stacked Stone Veneer being installed on a LEED Certified Project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there are other LEED credits that stacked stone veneer products like Norstone can help contribute to.  Two of thee points are related to construction waste management, as all of our packaging can be readily recycled, and any excess material can be turned into aggregate.  A third point relates to indoor air quality, which natural stone contributes to due to its low emission of volatile organic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/20/Construction Waste Management on a Stacked Stone Veneer Project.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Stacked Stone contributing towards waste management credits on a LEED certified project&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope in the future that more LEED credits will become available to products like stacked stone veneer and other tile and stone products.  Our industry associations, including the Tile Council of North America, are working with the US Green Building Council to make more credits available for tile and stone, hopefully with a focus on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-sustainably-remodel-your-home/&quot;&gt;sustainable building materials&lt;/a&gt; and the life cycle cost of products.  A new carpet made from recycled plastic water bottles is no doubt helping the environment, but could need replaced every 2-4 years in a commercial setting, where a beautiful natural stone floor could last many lifetimes.  The good news is that we’re having these discussions and all parties want to get it right, not just for certain industries, but with environmental impact as the guiding force.&lt;/p&gt;

A lot of work goes into bringing a new color to market, including preliminary market research and fully vetting the stone supply line to make sure the colors stay consistent from batch to batch and the volume can scale with us as demand is created.  We actually started prototyping these two colors, among many others, to some of our longtime dealers and distributors last summer for feedback, and were excited to start seeing production material come over and start to get stocked in our warehouses starting late spring / early summer of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What immediately stood out with these two new colors is how similar they were to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/aztec/&quot;&gt;Aztec XL&lt;/a&gt; Series color, which we released a couple years back and has been a very popular addition to the line up.  The colors are all unique among these three products, but they all share the same iridescence and sparkle that makes Aztec so popular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/15/Norstone Sierra XL Stone Veneer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Sierra XL Stone Veneer Demo Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sierra is probably the color that we’re most excited about.  Open up any design magazine or walk into a model home in the past 5 years and you’ll have witnessed a grey takeover of the neutral color palette, pushing out the previously dominate beige tones of the mid 2000s on.  Sierra fits squarely in that color range with a very attractive color range that is mainly grey with an understated silvery touch to it, that all gets accented by the occasional gold and rust colored accents throughout.  The accents are so important to the overall look of this product, giving Sierra a depth of color that really looks amazing on the wall, and adding a distinct “naturalness” to the product that can’t be replicated with a faux or man-made stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/08/15/Norstone Pearl XL Stone Veneer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Pearl XL Stone VEneer Demo Wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also really excited about Pearl, which is also perhaps the best fit for a product name that we have ever come up with.  Getting this product in your hands, whether seeing it at one of our dealer’s showroom on display or ordering a sample from our internal team, is the best way to see this product and really reveals the subtle variation of the off white hues and the “pearlescence” shine that gave this color its name.  We see this as a great product to use under a variety of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;lighting conditions&lt;/a&gt;, such as with natural light during the day and targeted LED light at night, as the stone will look quite different in each condition and really come alive on the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point there was some consideration to grouping these three closely related colors, Pearl, Aztec, and Sierra, into their own series, but ultimately we decided it was best to expand our popular XL Series Stone Veneer Series with the new colors.  The XL Series offers the largest individual stone sizes, yet still a part of an easy to use 6”x24” panel system.  XL also comes with a staggered end profile to reduce the appearance of vertical seams, which is important the bigger the individual stones are, and also comes in both our outside corner unit and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/natural-ends-norstone-s-latest-addition-to-standard-and-xl-series-rock-panels/&quot;&gt;natural end finish unit&lt;/a&gt;, giving transitions and starts and stops a more finished look!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’ve used our products before, or if you are just considering Norstone for your next stone veneer project, I would definitely encourage you to take a look at Pearl and Sierra as possible color options.  We’re incredibly happy and excited to put our 15 years of experience building thin stone veneer panel systems for sale to markets all across the world to use on these new products and look forward to seeing fantastic results with them for our current and future clients this year and beyond!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">This summer we officially launched two new colors in our XL Series Rock Panel Collection – Pearl and Sierra.

As anyone can attest, it’s a lot more fun and interesting to look at beautiful tiles from all around the world then a few pencil like strips of various color grout.  At Norstone, the only product we currently make that gets grouted is our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;Lynia Medium Format Mosaic Wall Tile&lt;/a&gt;.  Each Lynia tile unit consists of nine strips of either basalt or marble, that are each twelve inches long and come in three different heights.  The strips are mounted to a two layer backing system and staggered to create an interlocking mosaic wall tile and spaced out to create grout lines that are about 3 mm wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/25/Norstone Lynia Tile with Measurements.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Tile in Grey with Measurements shown in inches&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to grouting the Lynia series, we focus on making sure our customers are using the right type of grout, helping them understand how the grout color can change the way a product looks and needs to be installed, and finally proper techniques for grouting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two types of grout that can be used to install the Lynia mosaic wall tiles, either un-sanded or epoxy grout.  Un-sanded grout is designed for grout lines that are less than 1/8” wide, which the Lynia tiles fall into, and if sanded grout was used there’s also the potential that the grit of the sand will swirl or mark up the honed finish of the Lynia tiles.  Epoxy grout is another option, which typically comes pre-mixed.  When asked for a recommendation, we suggest the un-sanded grout since it is easier for most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/selecting-the-right-installer-for-your-next-tile-or-stone-project/&quot;&gt;tile installers&lt;/a&gt;, both professional and DIY, to work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grout color is another really important aspect of a project to consider when working with the Lynia &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/mosaic-tile-backsplash-norstone-designer-series/&quot;&gt;mosaic wall tiles&lt;/a&gt;.  Selecting a grout color that is slightly lighter than the stone is a good rule of thumb as it still allows the linear nature and design of the tiles to come through, but is more forgiving in terms of making sure all the grout lines line up and are consistent in size and spacing.  This is especially true for mosaic tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2018/07/25/Light Contrasting Grout Color on Lynia Mosaic Wall Tile Installation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Tile in Grey installed with a light contrasting grout color on an outdoor feature wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting a grout that is contrasting in color to the stone can serve to really bring out the design of the product, but requires a lot more skill and patience to get the install just right (think 100s of spacers to make sure the spacing is just right on both the horizontal and vertical gaps.  When done well, the Lynia tiles will really look amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fully cover how to install this product in our downloadable &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/assets/pdfs/Norstone_Installation%20Guide_Basalt-2016.pdf&quot;&gt;Lynia Series Installation Guide&lt;/a&gt;, but for purposes of today’s discussion, we’ll focus on just the highlights of the grouting process itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as technique is concerned, grout should be applied about 24 hours or longer after the tiles have been installed, and any excess thinset should be cleaned off the face of the tiles.  If the grout is not pre-mixed, it should be mixed per the manufacturer’s instructions, and you’re generally looking for a consistency that is a little less stiff than smooth peanut better, but not runny.  A grout float is used to press and compress the grout into the gaps and lightly scrape off excess grout from the face of the tile.  Use a sponge and clean water to remove the excess grout, taking care not to dig any of the grout out from the gaps.  When sponging off natural stone tile, its very important that you use a lot of clean water and constantly are rinsing the sponge.  The cleaner your sponge is the less grout haze you’ll end up with in a day or two!  The grout will end up being sealed as part of our recommendation to seal the entire stone installation once the grout haze is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
