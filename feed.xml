The design team had a landscape wall near one of the entrances that they needed to clad in a product that fit the modern design scheme of the building and would also stand up to the commercial nature of the application. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/ebony/&quot;&gt;Lynia Interlocking Tiles in Ebony&lt;/a&gt; were selected and checked off all the boxes of the product requirements. Let’s take a look around this area and see what made this natural stone mosaic interlocking tile a good fit for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Lynia Interlocking Tiles on Mall Facade.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Interlocking Tiles in Ebony Basalt color used on the facade of a modern retail mall outside of Minneapolis, MN&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that catches our eye on in this pulled back photo of the project is the overall style of the project, which is decidedly modern. A clean linear style is present in every material used on the exterior envelope of this project from the glass to the stone, right down to the benches flanking the landscape wall. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;Lynia Interlocking Tile&lt;/a&gt; is a mesh mounted tile unit where each unit has nine strips that are each twelve inches long, of varying heights, and are designed such that they form a very modern interlocking pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Ebony Lynia Interlocking Tiles on Commercial Landscape Wall.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Interlocking Tiles in Ebony Basalt color used to clad the landscape walls surrounding the entrance to a mall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next photo does a great job showing the relative scale of the Lynia Interocking Tile compared to the other products used on the exterior envelope of this building. Since it’s likely that you’ll be up close and personal with the landscaping walls, the medium format scale of the Lynia works well as its much easier to install than a small format mosaic and also ties together nicely with the larger scale veneers on the exterior walls of the mall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Durability was also a key factor in the product selection for this project. The harsh Minnesota winters, replete with snow, ice, salt, etc, can cause damage to products not suited for the conditions. Natural stone, in this case our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/the-difference-between-basalt-and-lavastone/&quot;&gt;Basalt stone&lt;/a&gt; in Ebony color, is a great choice for a durable surface. The darker colored grout keeps maintenance to a minimum, which is important for any commercial project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Close up of Lynia Interlocking tiles with modern light fixtures.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Interlocking Tiles in Ebony Basalt color paired with large vertically oriented stainless steel light fixtures spaced appx every ten feet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love this next photo of a large wall of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;stone paired with modern linear light fixtures &lt;/a&gt;every ten feet or so. Stainless Steel is very prevalent in modern design and architecture and beautifully contrasts with the darker tones of the ebony basalt color of the stone. The angle of the photo also gives us a small look at the very subtle texture of these interlocking tiles. Not designed to be a true 3D panel with lots of relief, the interlocking tiles have just a hint of dimensionality that is almost easier to feel than see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Lynia Interlocking Tiles on Commercial Landscape Wall-1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Lynia Interlocking Tiles in Ebony Basalt color on landscaping walls in a commercial project requiring durability and low maintenance&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grey skies and wet weather aren’t normally ideal for a photo shoot, so when we stopped by this project for a first look we weren’t sure exactly what we’d see. While maybe not perfect, we really do like the wet nature of the stone in these photos. With that little bit of reflectivity caused by moisture, the ebony color looks extra dark and holds it own in this modern design scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking a look through this cool commercial landscape wall project with us.

We got that opportunity with a great design and construction group last year shortly after launching our Planc large format tile product in the late Spring. We were so excited when we saw the first batch of photos showing the project under construction that we even shared it in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/planc-large-format-tile-hollywood-home/&quot;&gt;blog post from last November&lt;/a&gt;. This project is now complete and while everybody’s busy picking their jaws up off the floor, let’s have another quick look around and see how it turned out!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Norstone Platinum Planc Modern Home Facade.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Platinum Planc Large Format Tile on the front facade of a modern California home&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front exterior elevation of this house really sets the design tone from both a shape and construction standpoint as well as the materials selected. Starting at the flat roof line, rectangles abound, whether its in the upper stories with their walk out balconies or the windows and doors throughout. One thing we didn’t see the first time through was the really cool garage door chosen for the project. Smoked glass with powder coated aluminum cross bracing embraces the rectangular theme and runs with it. On first viewing this project last fall, we simply thought that the way the design team had chosen to install the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;Planc large format tiles&lt;/a&gt;, in a straight stack gapped both horizontally and vertically, was just a really cool modern way to use the product. Seeing the finished product, we now appreciate much more how it adds to the design theme that is so carefully curated throughout this front elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Norstone Platinum Planc Modern Home Interior Feature Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Platinum Planc Large Format Tile used as a background feature wall behind a large tv and smooth stone fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving inside, the front on view of this living room is absolutely stunning. Again, we are super impressed with the designer’s attention to detail here – subtle things like making the fireplace stretch exactly the width of two of the Planc sets isn’t something that happens by chance, but needs meticulously planned out and then executed on by multiple trades people. The author especially likes how the installer used an inside miter cut on the far corner and then continued the Planc sets on the next wall. A small detail to improve on the next project is to move the outlets down into the baseboards, which not only makes the stone installation easier because the installers don’t have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/installating-norstone-around-outlets-norstone-classroom-series/&quot;&gt;cut the stone around the outlets&lt;/a&gt;, but also helps keep continuity to the pattern from floor to ceiling and wall to wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Norstone Platinum Planc Modern Home Feature Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Platinum Planc Large Format Tile on an interior feature wall that continues from the main wall along the back wall of the home&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The side angle view of the living room taken from the kitchen shows the stone used in more places than we had seen in our first preview of the project. The detail along this back wall of the home again is extremely impressive, as the installer navigates sliding glass doors and an outside corner all without breaking the pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/Norstone Platinum Planc Modern Home Exterior.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Platinum Planc Large Format Tile on the rear facade of a modern California home with edgeless pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another new angle we’re seeing for the first time on this project is from the backyard looking towards the rear elevation of the house. Everything in this frame has ridiculously clean lines, from the pocket sliding glass doors which tuck neatly away into the wall to the edge-less pool design. The Planc tiles are a nice accent in this elevation against the more dominant smooth stucco and large format outdoor porcelain tiles of the pool deck. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/platinum/&quot;&gt;The Platinum color&lt;/a&gt;, since its lava stone, has unique surface textures and characteristics giving it an all natural look which complements the extensive polished woodwork throughout this project and gives a warmer touch against the other predominant man made materials like concrete and glass.&lt;/p&gt;

As such a stone installation can sometimes do things that are unexpected, especially when compared to a man or machine made product. One of the things we hear about occasionally with our stacked stone products is spalling, which is when small flakes, pieces, and sometimes even thin layers of stone fall off the face of stacked stone wall. First and foremost, this is a natural process and there’s no cause for concern! Now that we have that out of the way, let’s learn all about this unique property that some natural stones exhibit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To know if a stacked stone wall might be susceptible to spalling the first thing to consider is the type of stone itself. The majority of stones that can exhibit spalling are sedimentary in nature and have cleavage or fracture lines that result in breaks that are thin and can be of varying sizes. Mica is perhaps the most common and probably the most extreme example of a natural stone that exhibits these characteristics since it naturally comes in very thin layers that are easy to split off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/03/07/Mica Stone Split along Cleavage Planes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mica Stone showing significant layers that split off along cleavage planes during spalling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/how-to-install-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;stacked stone installation&lt;/a&gt;, the most common time you’ll see spalling happen is right after installation. It is at this point that the stone product, whether its a loose stone or part of a panel system like our Rock Panel and XL Rock Panel products, has experienced the most movement that it will ever experience. From the time the stone is quarried, manufactured / fabricated, transported (often multiple times to distribution centers and final destination), and finally installed, it is handled, moved around, jostled and sometimes even slightly abused more in that couple weeks or couple months than it ever will be again. During all that movement, the outermost layer of a stone prone to spalling can start to become loose and sometimes it will even spall off in the packaging, during installation, or shortly thereafter as the stone gets cleaned up post install and acclimates to its new environment (temperature, humidity levels,etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/03/07/Spalling from Stacked Stone Wall-1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;A small piece of natural stone that has spalled off a larger stacked stone wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normal spalling should be expected to occur before, during and up to about 6 months after installation as the stacked stone settles into its new home. For exterior installations weather patterns like freeze-thaw cycles or wet-dry cycles can bring an increased amount of spalling, but the amount of debris being removed from the face of a stacked stone wall should diminish over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/sealing-natural-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;Sealing a natural stacked stone wall&lt;/a&gt; isn’t specifically aimed at reducing the amount of spalling that might be happening in a certain installation, but by the very nature of what a sealer is intended to do will help. A sealer, by reducing the amount of water that penetrates into a stone, reduces the amount of movement in stone layers caused by moisture absorption thus helps reduce spalling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spalling that is occurring beyond the normal range of time post installation or happening as a result of repeated triggers, such as a freeze thaw cycle, might be the forerunners of bigger problems in a stacked stone installation. If certain steps were missed, such as the application of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/waterproofing-membranes-for-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;water proof membrane&lt;/a&gt; in an exterior installation, or if the wrong type of stone is being used for a specific application, such as a stone that is not freeze-thaw rated / tested being used in a cold climate, there could be bigger problems afoot. Contact your stone supplier with information about what is going on and they should be able to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/03/07/Stacked Stone Exterior Feature Wall with Lanscape  Beds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Exterior stacked stone residential project where the stone terminates into a landscaping bed to minimize the appearance of spalling stones&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughtful design consideration is another effective way to handle concerns related to stacked stone walls spalling. Installing stone on the wainscoating of a building is a beautiful look for a residential or commercial building, and if the stone selection is one that is prone to spalling, keeping landscape beds instead of hard surfaces below the stone is a great design idea. Any small pieces of stone that do spall off will end up in the landscaping and go unnoticed. Similarly, if stacked stone is designed to be installed above a pedestrian walkway, such as the entrance to a building, it’s a good idea to consider using a stone like quartz, granite, or slate that is not prone to spalling, or design in a ledge or similar shadowbox feature to catch any spalling.&lt;/p&gt;

This modern inspired home on New York’s Long Island was one of those project as we started working with design – build firm a few months out when they came across our natural stone products. They were looking for a large format natural stone product that would fit the clean modern lines of their project and fall in the grey to dark grey color range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product ultimately selected was the Charcoal color in our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/&quot;&gt;XL Series Rock Panel&lt;/a&gt;. The XL Series features the largest individual stones in any panel system that we offer and comes in a stepped end panel format to eliminate vertical seams in the installation. As with all of our panel series products, finger jointed outside corner units and natural ends are also available to ensure all the details of an installation are checked off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/03/06/Norstone Charcoal XL Field Unit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal XL Series Close Up of a Single Field Unit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The product was used in a bump out space that extends out from the main side wall of the house. The bump out is unique in that it’s only one floor tall, creating the opportunity to have an elevated outdoor area on a flat roof above the bump out. We really like how the design team used a stainless steel cap piece and bracket to hold up the frame less smoked out glass railing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/glass-steel-stone-for-modern-homes/&quot;&gt;Stainless steel and smoked out glass&lt;/a&gt; offer a very complementary color pallet to the dark grey hues of the charcoal and are a perfect fit for the modern vibe of this design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scale of the XL Series panels is also a great fit for an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/exteriors/&quot;&gt;exterior stone veneer application&lt;/a&gt; such as this one, especially on full or multi story applications. The XL series provides just enough of dimensionality and geometry in design that the designers were looking for without being too busy like a smaller format stacked stone panel system might look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/03/06/Charcoal XL Residential Exterior Stacked Stone Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal XL Stone Veneer Panel used on the exterior of a residential home on a bump out with an open air terrace on the flat roof above it&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the aforementioned stainless steel and glass components, some of the things that really stand out in this exterior to us are all the other complimentary surfaces and products that are part of this design. The ultra smooth stucco walls are designed to look as close as possible to a polished concrete tilt up wall to give off that industrial modern vibe and serve as a nice foil texture wise to the dimensionality of the stacked stone panels. The dark pavers walkway and patio that border the space reinforces the color scheme of this entire space while also not straying from the clean modern lines found in the stone and other surfaces. Lastly, the black granite rip rap size boulders give great contrast to the variety of smooth textures and help bring a more natural element of design set against the pavers, smooth stucco, glass and steel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/03/06/Charcoal XL Exterior Stacked Stone Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal XL Stone Veneer Panel used on the side exterior wall of a modern designed residential home on Long Island&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final thing that we wanted to point out was the interesting contrast the stone is showing off as it dries out after a rainstorm in these photos. Most of the time you wouldn’t want to photograph an installation showing it partially wet, but there’s something about the way the stone and the stucco look as they dry out, set against the glossy wet look of the pavers that really makes these photos pop. One of the great things about any installation of natural stone veneer products is that as the product gets wet and then dries out the stone almost starts to come alive on the wall as it goes from a darker wet color to a lighter dry color. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/sealing-natural-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;Sealing natural stone&lt;/a&gt; mitigates this effect, which is something to consider when sealing the stone is optional and not required based on the specifics of an installation. There’s not too many other durable products for exteriors that give you that kind of show!&lt;/p&gt;

So it’s not a big surprise to us that our industry hasn’t been on the forefront, or really even mentioned in the political crossfire that has accompanied these tariffs. But the reality of the situation is that these tariffs do impact our industry. Small increases have already taken effect and a much larger potential increase looms with uncertainty out on the horizon. Let’s unpack what has transpired already, what might yet happen in the future, and what this means for the US stacked stone consumer in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/03/04/US Chinese Tariffs on Stacked Stone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Import containers with the US and Chinese Flags showing the escalating tariffs by the US on Chinese goods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To bring the reader up to speed, as of this article’s publication in March 2019, the standard import tariff on most stacked stone HTS import codes on Chinese goods increased from 6% to 10% in September of 2018. A proposed further increase to a 25% tariff was scheduled to come into effect for January 1, 2019 but was postponed in early December until March 1 with China and the US agreeing to a temporary truce. It was then later announced towards the end of February that the March 1 deadline would be extended but neither the US nor China gave a new concrete date for the new deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not well versed in what this means, the easy to understand version of these tariffs is that currently the US government levies a tariff of 10% on the cost of the good being imported, which the importer pays to the government. It’s important to distinguish the increase in the tariff from increases in the cost of these products to the end consumer. The final end user price on an imported product almost always will include domestic transportation as well as a mark up for the US importer or distributor, hence the Fall 2018 increase from 6% to 10% hasn’t resulted in that large of an increase to the end user. Even if the full 25% tariff does come into effect, stone industry experts estimate that the increase to the end use might be between 10 and 15%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/03/04/US Chinese Tariffs on Stacked Stone Imports.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Container boats being unloaded at a US Port from China highlighting the escalating tariffs on imported Chinese goods&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Chinese exporters have been reacting to the changes by increasing their stock holdings in the US ahead of the proposed increases. There was a serious shortage of container space on boats heading from Asia to the West Coast of the US this fall with exporters aiming to clear and enter their goods before the tariffs increases took effect. The current unknown status on a trade deal is likely keeping Chinese exporters leery of putting too much cargo on the water, not knowing what the tariff will be when the containers arrive in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the author’s opinion, the losers in this deal are both the American consumer and Chinese stone manufacturing companies. While the stacked stone industry is an almost minuscule part of the total tariff package and trade deal, the increases in tariff rates will at some point hit the American consumer in the form of higher prices on these stacked stone goods. Higher prices in construction materials might mean &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-diy-infographic/&quot;&gt;people put off renovating their properties&lt;/a&gt;, or use other wall covering products in place of stacked stone like porcelain or ceramic tiles from Europe, South America, or made domestically. Chinese manufacturing companies are also likely feeling the squeeze with less new investment money coming their way as business people mitigate risk and opt for other places to invest their money as a result of the unknown future state of the tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winner in this deal are companies that are manufacturing competing products in places besides China. Countries like Vietnam, Thailand, and India among others in Southeast Asia do not have nearly the level of manufacturing prowess as China, but with the potential for a 25% tariff on Chinese products into the world’s biggest market, opportunistic manufacturers, exporters, and importers will definitely be making plays in these countries.&lt;/p&gt;

This particular space had a number of outside challenges as well – no natural light and 12 foot ceilings with the only light fixture being just above head height on the mirror chief among them. The homeowners were looking to do something to break up the incredibly tall wall behind the toilet and lighten up the space in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/white-marble/&quot;&gt;Lynia Interlocking Tile in White Marble&lt;/a&gt; was used in this application to meet those two primary design goals. The interlocking nature of the product makes it very appealing for a wall in need of some visual interest and the white color of the marble used in this particular color gives a nice contrast against the base grey tones of the wall and also helps brighten up this natural light deprived space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/27/White Lynia Interlocking Tile Powder Bath Feature Wall.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Marble Lynia Tile Installed on a feature wall behind the toilet in a powder bath&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homeowners decided to install the tile units with a vertical orientation for both practical and aesthetic reasons. Normally the Lynia Interlocking tile would be installed such that the 12” lengths of the individual tile strips are run horizontally along the wall. In this particular application the tile unit is turned 90 degrees and the 12” lengths run vertically up and down the wall. From a practical standpoint the homeowner told us that by installing the tile with a vertical orientation there were almost no cuts at all in this installation, except for the starting row against the floor tile and the top row against the ceiling. The feature wall here is almost three Lynia Interlocking Tile units wide, so all the homeowner had to do is use a utility knife to cut two strips off of one unit for each row of tile installed.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-pattern-impacts-stone-installations/&quot;&gt;Pattern selection can impact the complexity of a tile installation&lt;/a&gt;, and should always be considered before ordering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an aesthetic standpoint, the vertical orientation of these tile units also helps accentuate one of the more interesting elements of the space, which is the twelve foot ceilings. A powder room with twelve ceilings is definitely something you don’t see every day to begin with, and having so much wall space in a relatively confined area of a powder room gave the space a closed off feel. The light grey color of the walls certainly didn’t help with creating more of an open feel. By bringing in the White Marble Lynia Tile a good chunk of that vertical wall space became a much brighter color and helped open the space up color wise. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/installing-norstone-vertical-orientation/&quot;&gt;vertical orientation of the interlocking stone tiles&lt;/a&gt; creates movement up the wall, taking advantage of the height of the space. Combining a lighter color and the pattern that draws the eye up the wall helps make this small space look bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The homeowner was incredibly happy with how this turned out and relayed that as a moderately skilled DIYer, this project was well within the range of his skill set. He spent about an hour the first day installing cement board over the existing drywall, and then installed the tile the next day with no help with about 4 hours worth of the work. He came back the next weekend and grouted which took about another two hours once everything was cleaned up. As with most DIY Homeowner projects, there are plans to paint the walls a lighter color and install a new mirror and lighting fixture, as time permits.&lt;/p&gt;

Each product and installation method comes with its own set of pros and cons. So let’s take a closer look at each of these product types and learn the good, bad, and ugly to help you decide what’s the right product for your next stacked stone veneer installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/18/Hand Stacked Loose Stone on a Pallet.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional Hand Stacked Loose Stone on a pallet ready for installation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to start off with loose individual stones because this method really is the original when it comes to stacked stone. Hand stacked stone has been around for centuries – just take a look at many forts, castles, city walls, etc and you’ll see examples of stonework that has been hand stacked and stood the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/18/Hand Stacked Loose Stone Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Traditional Hand Stacked Loose Stone on a garden wall with a bench in front of it&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the main advantages of using hand stacked loose stone are the breadth of stone options available to you. Pretty much any stone can be used, or modified to be used, to be stacked on a wall. Stone masons are adept at using rock hammers and chisels to strike larger stones at just the right point to break it into smaller pieces or into a certain shape to fit the installation. With the variety of stone available for an installation like this, it also opens us this category of stone veneer to almost every price point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drawbacks of hand stacked loose stone is that skilled, experienced labor is a must for a great looking installation. The installation process can often be tedious and slow, and some loose stone installations also will get “mortared in”, meaning masonry mortar is “pointed” into the gaps between each stone. The combination of a skilled installer plus a lengthy installation can make the cost of installation high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/18/Stacked Stone Panel Veneer-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Rock Panel stone veneer panel system&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stone panel systems have been around for about the past 15 years or so, and are made possible by advances in stone processing equipment that allows the stone to be split and cut into thinner sections. These “thin” stones are then glued together, or sometimes mounted to a backer in a standard size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantages of a stone panel systems is in the relative easy and therefore &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/save-money-with-thin-stone-veneer-panels/&quot;&gt;lower labor cost to install stone panel systems&lt;/a&gt; as compared to hand stacked loose stone. The ideal installer for a stone panel system is a tile installer with some experience in setting natural stone tiles, but is also well within the range of most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-diy-infographic/&quot;&gt;DIY homeowners&lt;/a&gt; as well. Because the product comes as a repeatable shape, it can be installed quickly and efficiently, sometimes 10x as fast as hand stacked loose stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/18/Stacked Stone Panel System Feature Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Rock Panel on a large foyer feature wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest disadvantages of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;stone panel systems&lt;/a&gt; are the relative cost of the product is much higher than unprocessed loose stone, but when factoring in the lower cost of installation many times stone panel systems actually end up costing less on an installed cost per square foot basis. Another disadvantage to stone panel systems is that there are seams in the installation – whether its vertical or horizontal, wherever two panels come together a seam is formed. The extent to which this is actually a disadvantage should be considered when evaluating a stone panel system. Are the ends staggered so vertical seams are minimized? Does the product have lots of “relief” or “dimensionality” to each panel that helps hide these seams? Take a look at the product installed, whether that’s in a showroom, on their website, or a local example installation and see for yourself if you see the seams in a stone panel installation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there’s no right answer for whether hand stacked loose stone or stone panel systems is the right type of product for your project, the data certainly suggests that stone panel systems are worth considering. There is more stone going up on walls now than ever before because of the advances in manufacturing that make what once might have been an ugly stucco wall a beautiful stacked stone wall. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/vetting-natural-stone-veneer-manufacturers/&quot;&gt;Norstone is a natural stone manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; at the leading edge of the stone panel system revolution, having made premium architectural grade stone panel systems for over 15 years.

We really keyed in on the ability to set the large format tiles in different patterns as being the main source of versatility. Instead of just a plain old running bond or brick set pattern, the Planc product really shows it uniqueness when installed in unique patterns like symmetrical and asymmetrical straight stacks, herringbones, diagonals, and more. Our eyes were opened yet again by this product when the first photos of this week’s featured project came across our desks. The design and installation team on this seemingly straightforward commercial exterior took four colors of the Planc and created an incredibly unique and stand out feature. Let’s take a closer look at what they did and how it was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/11/Planc Large Format Tile Mixed Color Installation - Commercial Exterior.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Commercial Exterior ADA Ramp with a large installation of Norstone Planc Large Format Tiles mixed in four colors&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The largest uninterrupted section of the wall where the Planc Large Format Tile was installed is part of a incline ramp leading to the front door of this commercial space. The colors used in this installation are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/platinum/&quot;&gt;Platinum Lavastone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/grey-basalt/&quot;&gt;Grey Basalt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/ebony-basalt/&quot;&gt;Ebony Basalt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/silver-quartz/&quot;&gt;Silver Grey Quartz&lt;/a&gt; in the Planc Series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that really catches our eye about this installation is that colors selected create both a contrast and also blend together. Specifically, the dark tones of the Ebony Basalt color create a huge color contrast with the very light silvery grey tones of the Silver Grey Quartz. It’s worth noting that the Silver Grey in the bright exterior natural light comes across as almost white, whereas in interior applications and under different lighting conditions much more of the silver and grey tones show up. The Grey Basalt and Platinum &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/lava-stone-rocks/&quot;&gt;Lavastone&lt;/a&gt; then actually come together with very similar light to medium grey tones which gives the wall a solid base tone from which the darker Ebony and lighter Silver Grey bounce off of quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/11/Planc Large Format Tile Mixed Color Installation - Commercial Exterior Parking Lot-1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Commercial Exterior Feature Wall with four colors of Norstone Planc Large Format Tile mixed together in a random pattern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Platinum Lavastone was a unique selection among the four colors picked as its the only stone that has naturally occurring veining and striations in it. This is a subtle detail, but one that is actually very important to the overall look of this installation because it unequivocally lets you know that what you’re looking at is natural stone. If all the colors selected had a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/split-face-vs-honed-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;smooth honed natural stone finish&lt;/a&gt;, it would be hard to know what type of product is actually on the wall – tile, metal, even plastic exterior products would all be possibilities. But with the Lavastone comes that amazing natural veining that makes this unmistakable as natural stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent a lot of time looking at this installation and it looks like to us that the four colors are in even ratios. There is also no discernible pattern, other than that the installer laid the product horizontally and kept the same height plancs in each row. There’s also no discernible pattern to the color variation. Overall, we think the “randomness” of the pattern and color mix add to this installation, keeping it one big mash up instead of uniform, which speaks again to the inherent nature of natural stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/11/Planc Large Format Tile Mixed Color Installation - Commercial Exterior Planters.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Commercial Exterior Planter and Landscaping wall clad in a mix of four colors of Norstone's Planc Large Format Tile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact on this small planter wall at the other end of the building’s entrance is, in our opinion, less pronounced. With four colors to mix together and share the spotlight, the larger the wall the greater the effect will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years we’ve seen a handful of clients use our Rock Panels in mixed applications, most often with the contrasting colors of our White Quartz and Charcoal, but the end result never really got our hearts pumping like this project does.

Each of these products will get tested in its own way on your project, so making sure the product selected meets the requirements of the project is an important step that must not be missed. Natural stone veneer and the companies that manufacture them are pretty easy to vet because the product is ultimately not that complex and a good manufacturer should have all have the information you need to verify the applicability of their product against your requirements quickly and easily. Here are a few things to consider when vetting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/&quot;&gt;natural stone veneer manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are your product questions easily answered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good natural stone veneer manufacturer should be easy to approach and answer any question you have about their product and its applicability for your specific project conditions without any hesitation. Important details, like what type of stone the veneer is made out of, can it be used exterior or is it interior only, and can the stone be used in submerged applications or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/freeze-thaw-and-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;freeze-thaw climates&lt;/a&gt; are some examples of questions that a natural stone veneer manufacturer should have no problem answering and as appropriate providing the appropriate testing documentation. Even better if those questions can be answered via online resources on the manufacturer’s website or a specific technical services phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/04/Norstone White Rock Panels - Denmark Fireplace - Vetting Natural Stone Veeneer Manufacturers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Rock Panels on thin fireplace in Denmark with a large chest level staineless steel fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further investigation would be recommended if the manufacturer can’t provide concrete documentation on a specific requirement that is applicable to your project. For example, if you are installing stone veneer exterior in a freeze-thaw climate and the manufacturer can’t provide independent lab certified freeze thaw testing you might consider another natural stone veneer that has had the testing done and results available to view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do they have project photos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good litmus test of any natural stone veneer manufacturer is the quality of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/&quot;&gt;project photos&lt;/a&gt; on their website and printed literature. An immediate red flag would be the absence of any photos, photos that look like computer renderings, or close up photos of just the product itself (normally taken on a factory floor somewhere!) and not of actual completed projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/02/04/Norstone Charcoal Rock Panels - Niagra House - Vetting Natural Stone Veeneer Manufacturers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Charcoal Rock Panels used on exterior facade of ultra modern home in Niagra Falls Ontario&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, do the project photos the stone veneer manufacturer provides come up on par with the project you are working on? Whether you’re designing a feature wall on a new restaurant or a fireplace remodel on your own home, a manufacturer that can’t show they’ve worked on projects at a specific level it might be because the products simply don’t look as good as the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lastly, are there a lot of photos – not just one or two? A manufacturer can claim they’ve been around for a long time on an “about us” page but can they back up that claim with a large body of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are they experts in the industry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another good way to vet a natural stone veneer manufacturer is to try and understand their position in the natural stone veneer industry as a whole. Do they work with and / or have affiliations with industry associations like the Marble Institute of America and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/learning-the-best-practices-for-tile-and-stone-installations-by-the-tile-council-of-north-america/&quot;&gt;Tile Council of North America&lt;/a&gt;? Are they active on social media channels and share more than just information about the it products? Have the won awards, received recommendations or accolades from trusted companies and individuals in the construction and architecture &amp;amp; design community?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting a natural stone veneer for any project just on price is a risky proposition, as the cost of rework on a product installed incorrectly or not suited for a specific application will almost immediately outpace any difference in the starting price difference between any two natural stone veneer options. Natural stone is a veneer option that can outlast almost any structure so Norstone encourages all consumers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/&quot;&gt;natural stone veneer&lt;/a&gt;, for any size project, to consider who the team is behind the stone and pick the best option for each project.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">With the Spring Building Season right around the corner, lots of folks are starting to think about projects involving stone veneer that will be happening over the next couple of months.

A remnant of that period that we have a special affinity for is the two sided or see through fireplace.  At Norstone, we do some of our best work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/fireplace/&quot;&gt;natural stone fireplaces&lt;/a&gt;, so when you’ve got two sides a fireplace, it’s basically double the fun!  All jokes aside, the two sided fireplace has evolved from what started out as an interesting way to share a fireplace, normally between two living areas, into something that designers are using in far more interesting places and applications.  Today’s blog features a two sided fireplace that is super unique because it’s exterior and bridges the gap between two very unique spaces.  Let’s have a closer look at this really cool space done up in our Aksent modern stone veneer panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2019/01/28/Ebony Aksent Stone Veneer Two Sided Exterior Fireplace-1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ebony Aksent 3D Panels used on an outdoor two sided fireplace with a large open air patio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to understand about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/5-outdoor-stone-fireplaces/&quot;&gt;outdoor stone fireplace&lt;/a&gt; is the two spaces that it’s looking out onto.  In the above view of the fireplace you see this beautiful pillar of stacked stone with the stainless steel gas fireplace situated in an open air residential patio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come around 180 degrees on that fireplace and you’ll see that the other side (seen in the photo below) is the focal point of a unique private outdoor room, that is very much open to the elements, with just a pergola roof, but affording a lot of privacy by design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fireplace itself is a very large unit with a significant stainless steel border situated around the perimeter of the unit.  The stainless steel is a great color to pair with the dark tones of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/aksent-modern-tiles/ebony/&quot;&gt;Ebony Aksent 3D panels&lt;/a&gt;.  The large linear format of the insert, as well as the clean lines of the stainless steel and glass paneling create a very modern vibe which is obviously right in line with the geometric design  and clean finish of the Aksent 3D stone veneer panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surrounding products in the space offer up a nice contrast in colors and texture to the extremely modern vibe of the fireplace and stone veneer.  The private outdoor room is framed out of high quality lumber that has been either painted or stained to create a very consistent look and homogenize most of the character that might come through from the wood grain.  The patio floor actually appears to be a stamped concrete look (note the expansion joints) that introduces a rougher texture and two tone look to the space.  While the square and rectangle pattern does speak to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/lynia-and-aksent-launch/&quot;&gt;geometric design of the Aksent stone veneer panels&lt;/a&gt;, the modern look of this space could definitely be kicked up a notch or two with a flooring tile or paver with a single color and linear format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most interesting things in the two sided aspect of this fireplace is that the patio side places the fireplace at a little higher than waist level, whereas the outdoor private room has it at basically knee level.  This is perfect for each of the spaces to encourage people to linger in conversation on the seating of the exterior room and serve as a perfect backdrop for a bar height party in the outdoor space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our favorite two sided fireplaces was done on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/ochre-ochre-everywhere-in-this-magnificent-austin-tx-modern-home/&quot;&gt;modern styled home in Austin, TX&lt;/a&gt; where the fireplace went from the dining room on one side to the outdoor patio on the other.  Both that two sided fireplace and the one in today’s blog are really cool examples of how you can create a bridge between two spaces with a fireplace.  Whether you’ve got a one sided or two sided fireplace, we encourage you to think outside the box and create more than just a regular boring fireplace on your next project.  And know that Norstone is here to help clad that fireplace, however many sides it has, with the best natural stone veneers for fireplaces on the market!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">Once we saw this project, we knew we had to share it with on the blog.
