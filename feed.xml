From a stone standpoint, there’s two main areas of concern that our clients occasionally see – discoloration of the stone over time and the stone itself heating up to the touch.  Let’s take a look at what causes each of these and the best way to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discoloration on the stacked stone face of a fireplace is almost always caused by a malfunctioning fireplace insert or improper use of a more traditional wood burning fireplace box.  Wood smoke is a heavy carrier of natural carbon compounds that will easily attach themselves to the rough texture of a stacked stone wall in the form of soot.  Even gas fireplaces, since most of them rely on natural gas or propane that has an added chemical compound to make the gas smell for leak detection can create detectable exhaust staining against stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/12/05/Stacked Stone Fireplace With Soot Staining.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Soot Staining on a stacked stone fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix the problem of smoke or excess gas fireplace exhaust coming into the room it’s best to perform normal checks like ensuring the damper is open and flue is clear of any obstructions, the room has adequate air supply for the fireplace, the grate is positioned correctly within the firebox and the wood being burned has the appropriate moisture content.  If the fireplace is still letting smoke / exhaust into the room, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-find-a-contractor-on-houzz/&quot;&gt;find a fireplace expert&lt;/a&gt; to consult with and have check for other potential problems like a mismatched fireplace opening for the flue, lack of chimney or flue length for the application, downdrafts, and negative pressure situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/12/05/Stacked Stone Fireplace with Gas Exhaust Stain.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Gas exhaust discoloring stacked stone on a fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the fireplace is operating correctly, fireplace soot and exhaust is best removed from the surface of stacked stone in a tiered process, going from least abrasive to most abrasive cleaning agents.  The first tier would involve using a simple detergent based soap, hot water, and a stiff plastic bristle brush to remove the staining.  If that isn’t successful, the next tier up would involve a non acidic stone specific cleaner.  We’ve used a product called Nanoscrub by Aquamix on our stone before with good results.  If the staining persists, the final tier involves spot treating the stain with a sulfamic acid solution.  As with any cleaning job on natural stone, always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application and test the cleaner on a sample, or in an inconspicuous place, first to confirm the results.  Once cleaned, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/sealing-natural-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;sealing the stone with a natural stone sealer&lt;/a&gt; is a worthwhile investment to make any future clean ups easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other common problem we see with fireplaces is that the stacked stone on the face of the fireplace unit itself is getting hot to the touch.  The heat can be caused by outflow from the fireplace or if the wall itself is heating up from the firebox / chimney.  This is more and more important today than even 10 or 15 years ago as many fireplaces sit right beneath expensive televisions and other electronics that can be impacted due to excess heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/12/05/Stacked Stone Fireplace with TV Installed Above.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flat Screen TV installed above a heat producing fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mocking up what would best be described as a temporary mantle is a good way to check for this.  Something as simple as a 2x6 supported on the sides positioned 18” above the fireplace will work.  Checking temperature above and below the temporary mantle with an infrared temperature gun, and comparing that to a baseline reading without the mantle will tell you if the heat is traveling up the face of the stone on the room side, which the mantle will block and result in lower temperatures above it, or if the temperatures stay consistent with the temporary mantle in place the wall itself is the source of the heat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fix these heat problems, its always a good idea to contact the manufacture of the fireplace insert itself to determine if the unit seems to be functioning within spec.  The manufacturer may be able to point to unit specific changes that can be made that will impact the way the heat is produced and distributed to fix the problem.  If the fireplace is a more traditional open fire box, making sure the right size grate is being used and possibly the installation of a mantel can prevent heat from continuing to travel up the stone face of the fireplace.  Excess heat, especially if its making the stacked stone face of a fireplace hot to the touch is a bad thing.  If simple adjustments to the fireplace insert don’t fix the problem, a fireplace expert should definitely be called to ensure the unit is operating safely and poses no risk of danger while operating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fireplaces are a welcome and desired addition to any home, and stacked stone is a great choice for a new application or to rejuvenate a dated fireplace.

From the facades of buildings to thousands upon thousands of fireplaces inside the loop and out in the ‘burbs, Chicago brick was a staple building material in the windy city for much of the past 200 years.  We love the brick look, and especially some of the companies that are now salvaging and re-using old Chicago brick for new projects, we also really love the design of this family’s Chicago living room with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;Norstone Lynia IL Tile&lt;/a&gt; in Ebony featured prominently on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/fireplace/&quot;&gt;large modern stone fireplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/28/Modern Living Room with Stone Tile Fireplace in Chicago.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modern inspired Living Room with prominent dark stone fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things that catches our eye in the space is the great use of color and light.  The Ebony Basalt Stone is naturally a very dark color, which could really bring down the overall look and feel of a room, but in this instance the space benefits from great natural light entering through two long dormer windows flanking the fireplace and glass door in the room.  Light colored flooring and accent colored furniture brighten up the room as well, but what catches our eye the most is the bluish green paint color on the side walls which works so well with the darker colors of the Ebony Basalt Stone.  Dark grey colors and the dark color pallete often have a significant amount of blue undertones, and in this example the wall colors are both light and cheery but also compliment the stone color perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/28/Modern Gas Fireplace Insert on Stone Tile Fireplace Chicago.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modern All Glass Fireplace Insert set at waist level on a black stone tile fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fireplace unit itself, as seen in this close up picture, is long and linear to compliment the patterned mosaic of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-install-mesh-backed-tile/&quot;&gt;easy to install mesh backed Lynia tile&lt;/a&gt;, and also raised to be more at waist level than the traditional fireplace position nearer the floor.  This glass enclosed gas fireplace is less about pushing out heat and more about great looks and the ambiance it creates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/28/Stone Tile Modern Fireplace with Built In Shelves Chicago.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Built in Cabinents and Shelves flanking a large modern stone tile fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Built in cabinets and shelving are always a great thing to have as a homeowner, and in this space there’s no exception.  The added storage of the cabinets helps keep the space live-able while reducing clutter when necessary, and all the surface space created by the counter tops and shelves are a decorator’s dream.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-trends-when-it-comes-to-stone-smooth-is-in/&quot;&gt;smooth stone face&lt;/a&gt; of the Lynia Tiles as they wrap around the outside corner away from the fireplace and back towards the wall makes it easy to abut shelving or a countertop snug up against the stone, a common issue with built ins and more variable faced fireplace material like stacked stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/28/Stone Tile Modern Fireplace Chicago.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modern Designed Living Room with Large Black Stone Tile Fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This last picture does a great job of capturing the modern essence of the space.  All of the individual elements come together nicely, from the sleek and linear pattern natural stone tiles to the fireplace unit itself, to the bright and mid century inspired furniture, everything comes together to create a cohesive look.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’re fortunate enough to be one of those folks, or at least know somebody with a good contact list of contractors able and willing to tackle a variety of jobs, and most importantly do so at a high level of workmanship and service, you’re already one step ahead of the game when it comes to any construction project, big or small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For people without that knowledge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/selecting-the-right-installer-for-your-next-tile-or-stone-project/&quot;&gt;finding a contractor can be a daunting task&lt;/a&gt;.  Recommendations are always a great place to start, but if those get exhausted, you might find yourself in a really desperate situation.  Relying on historically shady internet advertisements on websites likes Craigslist seems like a bad idea, and simply searching google for “tile contractor «enter your city here»” might put you in touch with contractors that are either savvy enough to be a high search result, yet the question would remain how good their work actually is, or even worse, connect you with contractors that are spending a lot of money to advertise online and passing a lot of those marketing costs through to their clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/22/Houzz Contractor Installing Norstone Stacked Stone Panels.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Contractor found using Houzz reviews installing Norstone stacked stone panels&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s a homeowner to do that just desperately wants to redo their  avocado green bathroom or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/fireplace/&quot;&gt;replace their 1980s brick fireplace with stacked stone&lt;/a&gt; but can’t even seem to get started by finding someone to work with?  Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.houzz.com/pro/norstoneusa/norstoneusa&quot;&gt;Houzz&lt;/a&gt; – a social network that combines design and products and can be useful in bringing together clients and contractors.  We often recommend Houzz as a good starting point for our clients when they don’t know a contractor to do their installation.  Here’s a step by step process on using Houzz to find a professional contractor for your next project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/22/Houzz Home Screen to Find a Contractor.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Houzz Profile&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Right in the middle of the main navigation banner on all Houzz pages you’ll find a link to “FIND PROFESSIONALS”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;By selecting the “FIND PROFESSIONALS” button you’ll be prompted to answer a simple question “What service do you need?” and provide your zip code.  For our stone veneer panels and interlocking tile products we tell our clients to enter “tile setter” to yield the best search results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Read the contractors overview and look at the services they provide to make sure the type of work you have planned is something they have experience doing.  We tell our clients that have selected our stacked stone veneer panels to look for someone that has worked with “stone” or “natural stone” before to ensure they have experience working on the types of products they’ll be installing for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look at the number of overall reviews and the quality of each review.  The more quality reviews the better. Be leery of any contractor with a 5 star review, but not much detail in the reviews themselves – they might have just asked their family and friends to rate them on Houzz to build up their ranking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Each Houzz Professional can also post pictures and describe projects they have completed in the “Projects” tab of their profile.  This is a great chance to visually see the quality of their work but also the level of projects they have worked on in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Check for industry certifications in the pro’s profile that would indicate they are knowledgeable in certain fields.  A good certification to look for with a tile setter is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/learning-the-best-practices-for-tile-and-stone-installations-by-the-tile-council-of-north-america/&quot;&gt;Tile Council of North America’s (TCNA) Certified Installer certification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Look for Houzz badges on the pro’s profile, like “Best of Houzz  Service 2017”, which indicates they’ve received enough positive reviews in their area of expertise to be deemed “best of” by the good folks at Houzz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Understand if the professional you are reviewing is a contractor specializing in the specific area of expertise that you are in need of, for example “tile setting”, or if the result is more appropriately identified as a general contractor who has experience in a variety of different construction phases and needs, but might not be an expert in the field you are looking for.  Depending on the scope of your project, you might just need an expert, or a more general style contractor could work as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve found some professionals that you are interested in speaking with, take down their phone #s and give them a call to get the process started, or you can even send a preliminary message right through Houzz by selecting the “Contact Me” button on each Professional’s profile.  Use your own method (notebook,spreadsheet, etc) to keep track of who you’ve called, talked to, and are waiting for a callback from, and set a date out in the future to review what you’ve learned speaking/ interviewing each contractor, compare estimates, and hopefully select the contractor for your next project.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/22/Houzz Logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Houzz Logo Large&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Houzz is a great tool to increase your chance of finding a quality pro for your next project.  The social aspect of this network is designed to weed out inexperienced or bad contractors by the review system, so if you do end up finding and hiring a pro through Houzz be sure to help strengthen the community be leaving a detailed and honest review.  There are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/hiring-a-contractor-for-your-next-stone-project/&quot;&gt;lots of different ways to find a good contracto&lt;/a&gt;r, and some of the best are fairly elusive, not needing to even have a houzz profile because their work speaks for itself and they stay busy by word of mouth alone, but in the absence of that “unicorn” contractor that just doesn’t seem to exist for your project, check out Houzz as a good resouce for finding your next pro.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">Houzz is one of our favorite tools to get design inspiration and find cool and unique products, but it's also a great resource to find contractors for your next stone or tile installation.

Going to the movies sure has changed a lot in the past 5-10 years.  With a myriad of entertainment options available to the general public at home, along with high definition televisions, high powered surround sound systems, and even small scale theater rooms popping up in more and more mid range homes, customers have in turn sought out better experiences for their entertainment dollars when they choose to go out, and nobody is pushing the experience of going to the movies higher than the iPic theater in Boca Raton, FL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/13/iPic Boca Raton Lounge Norstone Ochre XL Fireplace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre XL on Fireplace at iPic Boca Raton Theater Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The restaurant and lounge area of the theater are a visual delight with some of the coolest and most imaginative interior décor features around.  Along with our Ochre XL cladding the stone columns and central pass through fireplace features, this space has amazing tiger skin colored and patterned flooring, a rough hewn reclaimed wood bar, an exceptional tongue and groove ceiling and some really cool plants which remind us of a bonsai, but on a massive scale.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-color-series-designing-ochre-blend/&quot;&gt;ochre color of the stone veneer&lt;/a&gt; was a great choice for this space as it bridges the colors of the flooring and the ceiling, while the product also has enough texture to not get lost a midst everything going on in this space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/13/iPic Boca Raton Lounge Norstone Ochre XL Column.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre XL on a column at iPic Boca Raton Theater Lounge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This corner table looks like a great place to grab a drink and appetizer either before or after a movie.  The design team shows a particular affinity for textures, with the stone veneer column and feature wall coming opposite the reclaimed and painted brick wall.  Not to be outdone, a highly textured basket-weave wallpaper forms the inside of this space.  A detail lost on many is the use of our outside &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stone-veneer-columns-norstone-classroom-series/&quot;&gt;corner units on the column&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/miter-cut-vs-corner-unit/&quot;&gt;unique finger joint system&lt;/a&gt; allows for amazing clean and easy to install corners like the one in this picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great design at the iPic in Boca Raton extends out to the patio area as well.  The stone columns help provide continuity to the look and design as they get extended out into this space.  The outside corner units again play a prominent role in the three sided columns and while not shown here, also clad two larger scale columns serving as a main entrance point to theater and lounge.  While most people associate South Florida with hot summer days, al fresco dining is a year round event, especially once the heat of the day subsides or with the aid of portable patio heaters on the chilliest of Florida’s winter nights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though this next photo doesn’t have any of our Norstone veneer in it, we can’t help ourselves from sharing it with our fans as just another amazing testament to the uniqueness of the design of this space.  Aptly named the Cocoon Lounge, this twisted and gnarled art installation forms one of the most unique seating areas in a bar or restaurant that we’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the iPic in Boca Raton, you won’t find sticky floors from spilled soda or the inevitable stale popcorn smell when you walk into the theater.

Corners are a natural focus point on any installation as the change in plan breaks up an otherwise ordinary field of stone or tile and creates a contrast that catches the eye.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stone-veneer-columns-norstone-classroom-series/&quot;&gt;Columns can be almost exclusively corners&lt;/a&gt;, making them one of the most difficult projects to tackle. With all that focus on a relatively small part of a project, you can see why installers focus on the corner and use all the tools available to them to make a corner looks its best.  Let’s take a look at the two most common methods of turning a corner using a stone veneer panel system – miter cuts and corner units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/07/Norstone Ochre Stone Veneer Corner Unit on Column.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Thin Stone Veneer Rock Panel on Column&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miter Cuts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Norstone first started making thin stone veneer panels almost 15 years ago we told anyone installing our product to miter cut one of our 6” tall x 24” long field units to form an inside or outside corner.  This process consisted of cutting a panel using a straight blade into two separate pieces, then back cutting each of those pieces using a 45 degree angled blade or wet saw rig.  Since the rock panels vary in thickness, this process was only partially about making the cuts – a good installer would go back and selectively trim pieces here and there along the corner to make the two sides come together nice and tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/07/Norstone Ochre Rock Panel Miter Cut on a Water Feature.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Miter Cut Natural Stone Corner on a Pool Water Feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Properly executed miter cuts are a great look, producing a clean, almost sharp edge that runs vertically along the outside corner, making them ideal for a modern clean look, but posing a challenge to under-experienced installers and slowing down production for even the most experienced of install team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norstone’s Finger Jointed Corner Units&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we continued to work more closely with both architects and designers that specified our products and the masons and tile setters that installed them, one of the areas they were in agreement about was the need for a corner unit.  For the specifiers, it made their job easier to specify a system and more importantly insured their vision of the project stayed true and didn’t get fouled up by a hasty installation team trying to miter cut in the field.  For a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/selecting-the-right-installer-for-your-next-tile-or-stone-project/&quot;&gt;tile or stone installer&lt;/a&gt;, a corner system was a no brainer – even at a marginally higher cost, a good corner unit system allows them to keep production high and offset the higher labor costs of miter cutting a corner in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/07/Norstone Stone Veneer Corner Unit Open and Closed.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Corner Unit Detail&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of this feedback is our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-classroom-session-working-corners-1/&quot;&gt;industry leading outside corner unit&lt;/a&gt;.  Each unit consists of two pieces, both 6” tall to match our field units, and alternating in either a 8” or 16” length.  These two pieces have “fingers” which are really extensions of individual pieces of stone in each panel, that are left with a natural cleft on the faces of the stone that face out.  The two pieces of each corner unit fit together and are specifically made for each other, in fact each corner unit is hand fit together to check for quality and a tight fit before being boxed up and leaving our factory.  The result is an easy to install outside corner unit that creates a natural looking rounded corner that we feel is the best looking corner in the thin stone veneer market.  Many manufacturers don’t have a corner option at all, and if they do, instead rely on a more basic dovetail style corner, which while much easier to manufacture, offers a far less seamless look to the corner.  Corners are just one of many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/what-makes-norstone-different-a-lot/&quot;&gt;details that make Norstone better&lt;/a&gt; than other thin stone veneer manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both the miter cut and corner unit options are still used everyday by our clients, we highly recommend our outside corner units.  Unless the installer has the right experience and tools for the job, and the customer is looking for the specific clean line look that a miter cut corner provides, a better option in almost every situation will be our outside corner unit system.  Our in house design reps and technical team are always available to answer any question you might have about a specific corner condition on your project, so never hesitate to call us with your questions, and until then turn your corners with care!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">On a tile or stone job, corners are not only where things come together, but also where details stand out.

This was a project we had the privilege of working on many years ago but it still holds up to this day in terms of uniqueness of design and the “wow” factor of the space.  Featuring our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/white/&quot;&gt;Standard Series White Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;, which have always been a favorite of designers looking for that perfect wall texture in a modern design, this highly calibrated product offers a unique clean line geometric look that would be impossible to replicate with hand stacked stone.  That, combined with the purity of our white stone, which is is unmatched in the stone veneer industry, makes this project something special!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/02/Norstone%20White%20Rock%20Panels%20Two%20Story%20Fireplace-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two Story White Stone Veneer Fireplace in Alberta Canada&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I love about this pulled out shot of the fireplace is how it shows all the modern design elements coming together in the space.  The floor to ceiling glass windows in the corner bring in great light and complement the cool and clean aesthetic of the white stone.  The mutli panel, multi size ceiling is an overlooked detail but shows that no detail was overlooked in this design.  Finally, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/flooring-for-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;swirl pattern carpet serves as an amazing contrast to the stacked stone&lt;/a&gt; and all the other clean design lines in the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/02/Norstone%20White%20Rock%20Panel%20Modern%20Fireplace-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cantilever Fireplace in Hotel Lobby with White Stone Veneer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing in on the fireplace itself, the cantilever insert which allows the fireplace glass to turn the outside corner is a subtle yet very cool detail not to be missed.  The veneer nature of the stone panels, which results in the product only weighing about 12-13 lbs per square foot, makes installations and details like this possible with such a tall installation.  Traditional mortared in stone or even brick wouldn’t be possible with this type of cantilever design due to higher weight loads or the need to set the brick / stone on a footer and not rely instead of direct adhesion of the panel to the wall.  This installation predates the roll out of our unique finger jointed corner unit, but as you can see, miter cutting the corners does offer a clean sharp look to the outside corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/02/White%20Rock%20Panel%20Fireplace%20Hotel%20Lobby-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Modern White Fireplace with designer furniture in hotel lobby&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked before about how furniture can complement a stone veneer installation, and this photo offers a great look at exactly how that can be done in an impressive way.  The overall modern design theme of this space is dominated by the multi story white stone fireplace, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-spec-build/&quot;&gt;design team&lt;/a&gt; has selected color coordinating low and sleek furniture to back that theme up.  The square shapes of the table, lounge, and chairs work with the geometry of the stone installation and are low to the ground to not block the look of the fireplace as the centerpiece of the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/11/02/Norstone%20White%20Rock%20Panel%20Feature%20Wall%20Hospitality%20Suite.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Rock Panel Feature Walls with Cabinetry&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a little bit left over due to a very high yield and low waste factor installing the lobby fireplace, the contractor on this project was able to create some cool accent walls in one of the hotel suites.  Flanking some nice wood cabinetry and being bathed by downward spot lighting, the white rock panels  are a perfect luxury addition to this awesome suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoyed this trip down memory lane as much as we did bringing it to you.  Our White Rock Panels are one of the unique products that make Norstone different than other stone veneer panels that you’ll find on the market.  Designers, like the team that worked on the Matrix Hotel project, recognize these differences and the projects they work on reflect it.  If you’re searching for truly unique stone veneer options for your next project, give one of our on staff designers a call and let’s discuss your project and see what natural stone options might be the perfect fit for the job.  Until then, happy designing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">One of our first projects in Canada was the Matrix Hotel in Edmonton, Alberta.

While our Grey Basalt Interlocking Tile and Grey Basalt 3D Panel have been an incredibly popular product over the past couple of years with the emergent trend of using grey in design and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-trends-when-it-comes-to-stone-smooth-is-in/&quot;&gt;preferences trending towards smooth surfaces&lt;/a&gt;, we consistently heard from our customers, and know from our own experience in the industry, that white and beige neutral colors will always be a hit.  We set out to source stone to make products to fill that gap and in doing so have doubled the size of our Interlocking Tile and 3D Panel range with the addition of White and Beige Marble colors in each of these series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/10/24/Norstone%20Lynia%20Beige%20Modern%20Mosaic%20Tile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Close up of Norstone Lynia Tile in Beige Marble Color&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these new colors are sourced from a different type of stone than basalt, it was appropriate for us to re-brand these series to more accurately reflect the products, thus our Basalt Interlocking Tiles have become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;Lynia IL tiles&lt;/a&gt; and the our Basalt 3D Panels have become &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/aksent-modern-tiles/&quot;&gt;Aksent 3D Panels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;The Lynia IL tiles stick with the format we know works well as a large format mosaic wall tile.  Each unit consists of 9 strips, that are each 12” long, and vary in height between 1”, 1.4”, and 2.4”.  The strips are staggered and set on a two layer backer.  The first layer is a thin plastic mesh to hold the strips together as a unit, and the second layer is a slightly more rigid thin backer to help create and maintain the spacing between the individual strips.  The units are designed to interlock with each other and are installed similar to other popular mosaic wall tiles, like glass, porcelain, and ceramic.  Now available in two colors of Basalt Stone, Grey and Ebony, as well as two new colors of Marble, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/white-marble/&quot;&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/beige-marble/&quot;&gt;Beige,&lt;/a&gt; Lynia IL modern wall tiles have you covered across the neutral color spectrum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Aksent 3D panels are a modern tile interpretation of our flagship rock panel product.  6” Tall x 24” long, these panels have a stepped end which allows them to interlock with adjoining field units, as well as pair with the outside corner unit or natural end available in this series.  The stone in this series has a honed face, which is smooth to the touch, but not polished or glassy.  Individual stone sizes range anywhere from about .75” to 3” in height and 4” to almost 12” in length.  The individual stones are epoxied together into the panel format to allow for rapid installation over vertical surfaces.  Two new colors in this series, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/aksent-modern-tiles/white-stone/&quot;&gt;White&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/aksent-modern-tiles/beige-marble-veneer/&quot;&gt;Beige&lt;/a&gt;, are a marble stone, and join the existing Grey and Ebony colors which are sourced from Basalt stone.&lt;/p&gt;

For today’s luxury homeowner, gone are the primitive days of clearing an area, stacking up some rocks or bricks in a circle, and singing koombayah under the stars.  A great looking, comfortable, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/fireplace-renovations-small-budget-project-with-big-return-on-investment/&quot;&gt;easy to use and maintain outdoor fireplace is a highly desired feature&lt;/a&gt; for many people looking to enjoy some of the cool Fall evenings that are upon us.  Let’s take a look at 5 cool outdoor fireplace projects that used our stacked stone veneer or natural stone tiles and see what make each one unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/10/19/Basalt%20Outdoor%20Stone%20Fireplace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Basalt Stone Outdoor Stone Fireplace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first stone outdoor fireplace was built earlier this year by a customer of our in Kansas, who used our Basalt 3D Panel product to create a corner fireplace in their lanai.  This particular unit has some cool  features, including the use of our ingenious interlocking finger joint corner to create some nice architecturally detailed corners, as well as both a gas fireplace unit and an outdoor tv for both rustic and modern entertainment.  The 180 degree view of the wooded area beyond the yard connects this space to nature, while still being a few steps away from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/10/19/Circular%20Outdoor%20Seating%20with%20Stone%20Fireplace.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;Tri Level Basalt Modern Outdoor Fireplace surrounding circular seating area&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This next project was actually one of our very first installations of our Basalt Interlocking Tile product.  This outdoor conversation pit partially surrounded by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-install-stacked-stone-on-curved-walls/&quot;&gt;curved and tri-level stepped outdoor fireplace&lt;/a&gt; is such a cool contrast in the curves of the circular seating area and the straight lines of the stone outdoor fireplace.  Stainless steel trim work along the vertical and horizontal breaks of the stone nicely complement the gas fireplace insert and the bright accent colors of the side tables, cushions, and pillows expertly contrast against the dark color of the natural stone tile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/10/19/Outdoor%20Firebowls%20by%20Pool.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fire bowls surrounding the spillway on a pool&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves the combination of fire and water, and the fire bowls in this home outside of Tampa, FL form the perfect backdrop for this outdoor space.  Whether you’re floating in the pool on a hot summer night and enjoying the shadows created by the stately palm trees, or getting steamed in the hot tub on a fall or winter evening, these fire bowls sitting atop two stacked stone columns are a fantastic addition to a high end pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/10/19/Large%20Outdoor%20Gas%20Firepit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Apartment common area gas firepit with basalt stone tile used as the veneer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proving that even multi family dwellers enjoy a nice outdoor space, this apartment courtyard complex in the metro D.C. Area has a great linear fire pit for the residents to enjoy.  The long rectangular shape of this fire pit ties in nicely with the long linear look of the basalt interlocking stone tile that clads all four sides of it.  Units like these aren’t known for giving off loads of heat, but instead focus on creating a welcoming space where conversation can flow freely no matter the weather or season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/10/19/Open%20Concept%20Outdoor%20Stone%20Fireplace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Curved open concept fireplace set amid Norstone Ivory Rock Panels&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last outdoor stone fireplace project is easily mistaken for an interior living or family room.  This lanai in Southwest Florida is jammed with details designed to “bring the indoors outside” like the prominent television and ceiling chandelier.  Easily lost in everything else happening in this space is an amazing outdoor fireplace complete with curved architecture, an open concept firebox, and luxury finished like&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/an-ivory-comeback-for-the-summer-of-2017/&quot;&gt; Ivory stacked stone&lt;/a&gt;, glass mosaic tile and stainless steel trim.  Details were not overlooked in this space – right down to the herringbone design of the firebrick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not too late to capture the beautiful fall weather with an outdoor fireplace or fire pit of your own.  While there are a lot of options out there, we recommend considering using natural stone as a primary building material for this project, trading a little more upfront cost for a long lasting, luxurious feature to be enjoyed for many years to come.

One of our great A&amp;amp;D teams based out of Tampa worked with the interior design firm on this project, who were looking for a durable wall finish for the long central corridor of the first floor, but also had a specific color range they needed to stick to.  Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;Ochre Blend XL Series Pane&lt;/a&gt;l was originally under consideration, but after an initial round of feedback with the design team, they were looking for something a little lighter and more vibrant in color, so we took a risk and showed them a product that we had only prototyped to that point, our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/aztec/&quot;&gt;Aztec XL Stone Veneer panel&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a perfect match color-wise and so we set our production team off to the races to complete the order in time for the grand opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/27/Aztec%20Stacked%20Stone%20Vener%20Hotel%20Lobby%20Orlando.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Aztec Stone Veneer used in hotel lobby main corridor&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a small lobby, the dominating feature of the first floor of this hotel is the long corridor which runs from the front entrance, past the elevators and conference rooms, to the rear of the hotel where most of the parking is located.  The design team knew this was going to be an important space – visually it needed to be welcome and interesting, and from a performance standpoint it needed to look great day in and day out.  The Aztec stone veneer was a perfect choice because its light earth tone color pallete is nice and bright and the durability of stone is unmatched in a commercial environment.  Incidental contact with a baggage cart will mark, scratch, and dent popular wall coverings like painted drywall or wallpaper, making stone veneer a great choice for long term commercial durability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Color-wise the Aztec also fit into the scheme of the other surface materials.  The somewhat nontraditional choice of a light olive base wall color complements the lighter earth tones of the Aztec stone veneer.  The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/flooring-for-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;light colored flooring is an excellent choice to match the stone&lt;/a&gt; and keeps everything bright and the dark wood stained trim does a nice job as an accent color and to create definition between the flooring and the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-school-pairing-lighting-fixtures-with-stone-veneer-for-amazing-results/&quot;&gt;Lighting natural stone walls&lt;/a&gt; is something we can never overstate the importance of – it can make a space go from normal to amazing with the flick of a switch.  The design team knew that even though this hallway would be well lit up 24 hours a day, some extra attention in the form of directional recessed can lighting can make a huge impact.  The texture of the stone veneer really comes out with the lighting and when looking at the stone head on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small but important detail that mainly goes unnoticed is the nice baseboard that separates the stone veneer wall and tile flooring.  While the color creates great contrast and definition, the practical aspect of this baseboard, functioning to keep the chemicals and other cleaning agents used to clean the floor off the stone on the wall is priceless.  Commercial spaces, like this hotel lobby / corridor, first and foremost needs to be practical in both everyday and long term use.  A great design team, like the one on this project, sweats these details and their clients love them for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sure were pleased this project came around to kick start the production and promotion of our Aztec XL Stone Veneer into a product we actively sell and stock in all of our US warehouses.  It’s a great color and is great alternative to our Ochre Blend color, for projects that still want to stick with the neutral earth tones, but want an overall lighter and brighter look.

We were, and still are, one of the few manufacturers of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/ledgestone-norstone-industry-series/&quot;&gt;ledgestone veneer&lt;/a&gt; panels that uses quartz and quartzite based stone in our products.  More recently, the term quartz is most often seen when discussing building materials relating to solid surface counter tops and we now frequently hear from clients that are more familiar with the counter top version of quartz than the actual quartz stone itself.  Let’s get those questions answered and figure out what the difference between the two really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/19/Raw%20Quartz%20Stone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Quartz Stone in Raw Crystal Form&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, quartz is a mineral made up of silicon and oxygen, linked together in a specific framework which allows quartz to have its natural crystalline make up.  Quartz is actually the second most abundant mineral on the earth’s crust!  Both Quartz Stone Veneer and Quartz Counter Tops are made of the quartz mineral, hence the name, but are actually very different in their composition and properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/19/White%20Quartz%20Rock%20Panel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone White Quartz Rock Panel Studio Shot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most stone veneer made from Quartz, including products like our White and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels/charcoal/&quot;&gt;Charcoal Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt;, is actually made from a derivative of quartz called Quartzite.  This is made through heating and pressure of quartz sandstone, resulting in a hard durable rock.  In other words, mother nature takes this prolific mineral found on the earth’s crust, and over the course of millions of years heats and compresses it into a very hard and durable stone.  Some of the benefits of using quartz beyond just its durability is the overall consistency of the product in terms of color and composition, as well as the workability of the raw stone, allowing it to be split, cut and otherwise fabricated into a variety of different finished stone products.  Most quartz also has a low to non existent iron content which helps prevent the problems associated with oxidation that other stones, namely slate, can experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2017/09/19/Quartz%20Countertop%20Kitchen%20Island.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;White Quartz Countertop on kitchen island in renovated kitchen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quartz Counter tops are actually a man-made material, where crushed quartz is mixed with a resin to produce the counter top.  The quartz and resin can be altered to give a range of looks from nearly solid colors to tops that mimic the natural look and feel of many popular natural stone counter top options like granite and marble.  Quartz however resists scratches, burns, and chips better than the aforementioned natural stone materials and also doesn’t need sealed.  With the consistency in color and finish that quartz provides, it has become a popular option for modern design.  While natural stone, namely marble and granite, still own the biggest market share of non laminate counter top materials, engineered stone options like quartz are the fastest growing segment of the counter top market and by 2019 are predicted to account for close to half the overall volume of their natural stone brethren.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team at Norstone loves to play around with new materials and as recently as this spring we prototyped some of our popular rock panel series using cut pieces of quartz stone countertops as the primary material.  Unfortunately we found the man made quartz to be inferior to the quartzite stone we currently use, namely as it related to the stresses associated with moisture and expansion and contraction during freeze thaw cycles.  While we would have loved to come out with a bold color line of Rock Panels in fire engine red, bright yellow, or royal blue, the man made quartz stone just didn’t stand up to the rigors of an exterior installation they way mother nature made quartzite stone does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can easily consider yourself a foremost expert on quartz, with more knowledge than the cabinet and counter top associate at your local home improvement store selling quartz counter tops, or the sales person at your local discount tile retailer that might be selling low quality stone wall veneer.  While this knowledge might not get you many places in life, or even be likely to answer the oddball geology question on Jeopardy, hopefully it does help you understand more about why we choose to make many of our products from quartz and quartzite based stone and what the difference is between the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/fireplace/&quot;&gt;Norstone fireplace&lt;/a&gt; you’re thinking about doing this fall just in time for the holidays and the counter top you had installed last year.  As always, our staff is well trained in all thing stone, so bring us your quartz,or any other stone related questions, and we’d be happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">More people than ever know the term quartz from the increasingly popular solid surface countertop material, but few know that the quartz stone that we make a lot of our natural stone veneer and tile products isn't the same thing. The difference is actually pretty substantial, so lets take a look at the difference between the two in this week's classroom session.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.norstoneusa.com/%7B%22src%22=%3E%22/uploads/2017/09/19/Designer%20Kitchen%20with%20Quartz%20Countertop.jpg%22,%20%22title%22=%3E%22White%20Quartz%20Countertop%22,%20%22alt%22=%3E%22Designer%20Kitchen%20featuring%20an%20island%20with%20a%20white%20quartz%20kitchen%20countertop%22%7D" /></entry></feed>
