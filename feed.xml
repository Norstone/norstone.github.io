There’s a myriad of reasons why, from the wrong substrate was used or an incorrect setting material – we’ve even seen a project where the installer set the stone when it was below freezing causing the thinset to freeze and never cure. Photos are always a great way to reveal the problem, so when we heard from a client recently about some of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;Planc Large Format Tile&lt;/a&gt; falling off an exterior feature wall installation the first thing we asked for was photos of what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/04/16/20200313_143451-min.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stone Veneer Installation on an exterior feature wall failing due to a spot bonding installation technique&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old saying is definitely true that a photo is worth a thousand words, but when we got photos of the failing installation from the client we only needed two words to explain what the problem was – spot bonding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot Bonding is basically where the installer uses their trowel to put a couple dollops of thinset onto each tile, sticks it on the wall, and moves onto the next one. Ultimately, spot bonding is mainly a time saving technique because its much faster than ensuring full coverage of the setting material across the back of the tile, and it also saves a little money since not as much thinset is going to be used. Most installers recognize the importance of having &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/thinset-coverage-for-adhering-stacked-stone-panels/&quot;&gt;full coverage of the thinset&lt;/a&gt; across the back of the tile, especially on floor installations where any voids between the tile and the subfloor can result in a cracked tile. Some installers make the incorrect assumption that since there’s not going to be a weight load on a wall tile that full coverage on the back of a wall tile or stone veneer isn’t necessary, and while they are correct that it’s very unlikely that a wall tile is going to crack, they are forgetting about that ever so important force called gravity. Without adequate coverage on the back of a wall tile or stone veneer the weight of the tile or veneer might prove to be too heavy, give way, and fall of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/04/16/20200330_135619-min.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Planc Large Format Tile Installation on an exterior feature wall failing due to a spot bonding installation technique&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the photos of the installation that failed, the distinctive circular smudges in the ares where the stone veneer has fallen off the wall are the tell tale sign that the stone was put up using spot bonding. The correct way to install wall tile or stone veneer is to ensure full coverage of the thinset on the back of the stone. The way we recommend doing this is to first trowel up thinset onto the substrate and then for most of our stone veneer products, notching the thinset with a 1/2” square notch trowel to create a setting bed suitable for large format heavy tile and stone products. Next, we recommend a quick back butter of each tile before it goes up on the wall. Finally, check for coverage every so often by pulling a tile you just set off the wall and looking at the back to see if thinset is everywhere or if there are any gaps. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/learning-the-best-practices-for-tile-and-stone-installations-by-the-tile-council-of-north-america/&quot;&gt;The Tile Council of North America&lt;/a&gt; (TCNA), the governing body for our industry in the U.S., recommends 95% coverage across the back of each tile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not only tough to see these photos and the product get used incorrectly, but with knowledge of a spot bonded installation, particularly of a heavy tile or stone veneer product, also comes the responsibility to recommend that the installation be taken down and re-installed using proper setting techniques. A spot bonded installation is absolutely a liability and can cause severe property damage and personal injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An easy way to avoid ever having to deal with a tile or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/how-to-install-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;stone installation&lt;/a&gt; that might fail due to spot bonding, or a wide variety of other reasons, is to use a TCNA certified tile installer. The TCNA certification ensures that installer has knowledge of the best practices for installing tile and stone. The manufacturer of the tile or stone is also a great resource, especially if its a DIY project. A detailed installation guide is worth a read even if you’re not the one doing the installation just to be familiar with what should be happening and to make sure that it does.&lt;/p&gt;

While it feels great to get started, that “before” photo makes the end “after” result that much more rewarding to see where you started and what you achieved. In this week’s project profile we’re looking at a set of before and after photos from a recent client that updated their fireplace using our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/aztec/&quot;&gt;Aztec XL Series Rock Panel&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s have a look at where this one started and how it looks now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-before&quot;&gt;The Before&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/04/14/Aztec XL Stone Panel Fireplace – Before.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Before photo of residential fireplace in need of updating with a dated ceramic tile surround&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fireplace before things got started is somewhat basic and dated looking fireplace surround. The room itself is beautiful, with great furniture, decorations, and finishes, but the fireplace surround was definitely lacking with a very basic ceramic tile surround. The fireplace is set flush with the wall, so a couple rows of tile and a bull nose is a quick, easy, and inexpensive way to “frame” out the fireplace. The fireplace before was high on function, but low on style, with the travertine look tile looking pretty dated in the middle of a really nice looking room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-after&quot;&gt;The After&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/04/14/Aztec XL Stone Panel Fireplace – After.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;After photo of a renovated residential fireplace with Norstone Aztec XL Series Rock Panels installed from floor to ceiling&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fireplace with the stone installed transforms the look of the room and creates more a true focal point for the space. The biggest difference is that the stone now goes all the way up to the ceiling. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/floor-to-ceiling-sierra-xlx-stacked-stone-fireplace/&quot;&gt;floor to ceiling fireplace&lt;/a&gt; stretches the space vertically which helps since the ceilings are somewhat low to begin with. Since the fireplace is set flush, the tile was able to be removed and the stone installed over cement board. The Aztec XL Rock Panels are going to vary between about .75” and 1.75” thick, so they create a slight recess of the insert. The homeowners could have chosen to reset the insert to sit more flush with the face of the stone if they so desired. The outer edges are trimmed out with a small moulding or trim piece to cover the exposed edge of the stone panels. This creates a boxed in look to the stone installation and maintains the illusion that the stone is thicker than it is by covering up the exposed edge.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/natural-ends-norstone-s-latest-addition-to-standard-and-xl-series-rock-panels/&quot;&gt;Norstone Natural End Stone Panels&lt;/a&gt; would have been another great option to have a finished look on the edges of the panels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we really think is cool about this project is that everything about the space is the same before and after except the stone, which really gives us an opportunity to see how one change can really transform a room. Often times a stone project is a smaller part of a large project, or at the very least a client is changing out paint colors or other decorating items like curtains or rugs. Compare the two photos and everything is the same, down to the placement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing the author would change about the finished look is to remove the mantle. There’s definitely a trend in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/fireplace/&quot;&gt;fireplace design&lt;/a&gt; where the mantles are being lost in favor of a complete look of the stone surround from floor to ceiling. Mantles were originally used to warm food, and then became a home for knick knacks and decorations, or served as a stopping point for the surround if it wasn’t going floor to ceiling, but in a renovated project like this one, where the stone fireplace surround now goes from floor to ceiling, I think removing the mantle, or replacing it with something less traditional and more contemporary rustic would be a good addition to this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for having a look at the before and after of this Aztec XL Series Rock Panel fireplace project. If you have a fireplace that needs updating, spring and summer is a great time to start working on it. Fireplace contractors get really busy in the fall and winter so take advantage of their downtime to get your project done quickly and be ready when the cold weather comes back.

One thing we at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/&quot;&gt;Norstone&lt;/a&gt; have always worked hard to do is seek out and foster relationships with architects and designers that are doing amazing work. The main way we do this is to create awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/contractor-grade-vs-architectural-grade-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;architectural grade natural stone products&lt;/a&gt; that these professionals want to work with, then backing those products up with great service during all stages of an architecturally specified project. Another way we support the A&amp;amp;D community is by going to their offices and teaching continuing education classes that architects are required to take to maintain their status with the American Institute of Architects, or AIA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/04/14/Norstone AIA Continuing Education Provider-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone AIA Continuing Education Provider Logo with Red and Black Lettering on a White Background&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AIA is the leading voice for architects in the United States. The AIA promotes education within the industry and works with both government and the private sector to advocate and champion architecture and the professionals in the industry. One of the main components of the education component of the AIA is that they partner with a number of different groups, including building material manufacturers like us, to create classes for their members. As a subject matter expert in a particular field, a building material manufacturer is a great resource to teach architects about that particular field or topic. The AIA continuing education classes are first and foremost about the education – each class is reviewed by the AIA before being approved to be taught to any of its members and the classes are brand agnostic, meaning although the presenter might be from a specific company speaking about the industry they are in, the classes are not an hour long sales pitch about their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In normal times, we enjoy teaching these classes in the offices of some of the great architecture and design firms we have the privilege of working with. Whether its over a box lunch or a mid afternoon snack plate, in person classes give us the ability to not only connect directly with A&amp;amp;D professionals but also bring in lots of materials to make the education deeper and more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/04/14/Norstone AIA Continuing Education Live Class.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone AIA live class in an architecture firm conference room with a presenter and handful of architects attending the session&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these certainly aren’t “normal times”, we’ve recently begun scheduling these classes in a “live – online” format, meaning the class will be taught live, allowing for interaction and communication between the presenter and the architects, but instead of meeting in a conference room we are all joined together remotely via webinar. While it’s not the same as being there, we do enjoy teaching these classes, making connections across the A&amp;amp;D community, and sharing our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/learning-the-best-practices-for-tile-and-stone-installations-by-the-tile-council-of-north-america/&quot;&gt;learning and teaching about tile and stone&lt;/a&gt; and an industry that has been around since the pyramids but still finds ways to be relevant every day.  The class we are currently teaching has to do with things to consider when designing with direct adhered natural stone cladding. The course qualifies for the standard 1 hour continuing education unit with the AIA and also has a the HSW (Health, Safety, &amp;amp; Wellness) designation. In the course we cover what direct adhered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/stacked-stone-cladding/&quot;&gt;natural stone cladding&lt;/a&gt; is and what makes it different from traditional building stone, how to specify it according to building code, and some of the sustainable and green friendly products of these types of products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might not be the routine way of getting credits, but while some architects and designers are experiencing a lull in project work as the economy remains unpredictable, working on their 2020 CEU requirements now will free up time when things return to normal later this year.

They are easy to use as accents and especially to create contrast, but making a cohesive space using the dark color pallete without it seeming dark and closed in can be a challenge. This week’s project profile meets that challenge and hits a home run in terms of great use of color. Featuring our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;Lynia Interlocking Natural Stone tiles&lt;/a&gt; on the backsplash, this space combines really unique cabinetry and great use of color and space to create a modern updated kitchen area with a distinctly rustic vibe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/25/Ebony Lynia Interlocking Tile Backsplash-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ebony Basalt Lynia Interlocking Tile on a Modern Kitchen Backsplash with Black Solid Surface Counter Tops and rustic cabinets&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lynia Interlocking Natural Stone tiles used on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/backsplash-tile-designs-norstone-industy-series/&quot;&gt;stone tile backsplash&lt;/a&gt; are the Ebony Basalt Color. Ebony Basalt is the darkest stone in our line up and we also fabricate it for use in our Aksent 3D modern stone veneer panels as well as our Planc Large Format Wall Tiles as well. The Lynia Interlocking Tiles used in this application are perfectly scaled for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/backsplash/&quot;&gt;backsplash application&lt;/a&gt;. Each Lynia unit consists of 9 strips of tile, each 12” in length with three different height. The strips are offset and come mounted on a two piece backer to create an interlocking pattern with the units surrounding it. The dark color pallete of the Ebony matches up nicely with the dark solid surface counter top as well as the grey color scheme of the walls. The stainless steel of the appliances are a nice contrast against dark color pallete and the cabinet color is a really nice mix of lighter colors that also bring in the darker colors as part of their color range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And speaking of the cabinets, while we love the way our stone looks on the backsplash of this kitchen, the cabinetry in this space is really the star of the show. Cabinetry is normally not something that you expect to see color movement in, but it really works out amazingly in this project. The rough hewn appearance with the vertical strip patterns give a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/rock-panels-rustic-kitchen-backsplash/&quot;&gt;rustic vibe to this kitchen&lt;/a&gt; which also works well with the flooring. Details make all the difference with a product like this and we love how the vertical strips and even the coloration of each strip line up vertically between the tall lower cabinet next to the refrigerator and the upper cabinet above. The dark undertones of the wood color range make a dark backsplash option like the Ebony Lynia Interlocking tile a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/25/Ebony Lynia Interlocking Tile Kitchen Backsplash.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ebony Basalt Lynia Interlocking Tile on a Modern Kitchen Backsplash in Spokane, WA&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key part of what this makes space able to handle the dark colors of the counter tops and backsplash can be seen in the reflection of the refrigerator and the sheen against the stone backsplash – you guessed it, great natural light. Great natural light paired with the low but ultra bright white ceiling are a perfect combination for a project like this one that is looking to go bold with their colors and materials. Reflective finishes like the the stainless steel and to a lesser extent the flat smooth surface of the stone backsplash and the natural sheen of the cabinetry help keep things bright during the daylight hours. We didn’t get a photo of this space during nighttime hours, but with the right lighting, especially some under cabinet lighting for the backsplash and counter top, this kitchen would look equally amazing both day and night.&lt;/p&gt;

The durability of stone definitely is an important consideration for a highly trafficked restaurant, not to mention the timeless appeal of well designed and installed stone veneer. With the COVID-19 pandemic settling in over the United States in early 2020, we wanted to put together a top 5 list of our favorite stone veneer installations in restaurants. With “social distancing” in full effect, we might not be able to see these in person for a while, so enjoy this list of great restaurant projects virtually!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;susanna-foos-gourmet-kitchen--pennsylvania&quot;&gt;Susanna Foo’s Gourmet Kitchen – Pennsylvania&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love this project because it as one of the first ever applications of Norstone in the United States. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;Ochre Blend Standard Series Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt; are used on multiple walls throughout the interior of the restaurant and also clads a central column complete with a circular cut out and an Asian inspired two way gong. This project was installed before we developed our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-classroom-session-working-corners-1/&quot;&gt;outside corner units&lt;/a&gt;, so the cuts on that column are all expertly done miter cuts that look fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hdi--abu-dhabi&quot;&gt;HDI – Abu Dhabi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bar and lounge area of this restaurant in Abu Dhabi showcases our Ivory Standard Series Rock Panels over a large wall. The color pallete is what we think is the star of the show with this project. The neutral tones of the floor tile and wall columns and beams let the warm cream to gold tones of the ivory complement each other quite nicely. The green plants give this space nice pops of contrasting color.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chipotle--south-florida&quot;&gt;Chipotle – South Florida&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time lunch favorite of the Norstone team, this Chipotle fast casual restaurant in South Florida leveled up their exterior veneer opting for our Lynia Interlocking Tiles in the Basalt Grey color in lieu of a more normal stucco or cmu split face exterior. The clean lines and grey color tones of this product fit right along with the normal Chipotle industrial style interiors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another South Florida favorite comes up on our list, this one being the Farraday’s Steak House at the Isle of Capri Casino in Pompano Beach. As with most casino based restaurants, you have to walk past the slot machines and gaming tables to find this place, but those that do are rewarded with a beautiful dining experience, both visually and gastronomically. Our Ochre Blend Rock Panels are used behind the bar and extensively throughout the main dining areas. We especially love the curved wall in this photo as it shows that our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-install-stacked-stone-on-curved-walls/&quot;&gt;stone veneer panels can be used on radius walls&lt;/a&gt; and allows for some really intimate tables to be built right into the wall, serving to break up a large space and help control noise across the restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

Some times these outdoor spaces are little more than the size of a small room, shoe-horned into the rear of a building with no view per se, but at the very least a little access to sunshine and if you’re looking straight up. It’s pretty easy for these spaces to feel drab and confined, with “hard” building materials like fencing and concrete walls forming most of the borders, and with limited sun exposure keeping grass or most plants alive sometimes isn’t possible. Such was the case with the interior courtyard we are featuring today which is at the rear of a single family residence in San Francisco that backs up on all adjoining sides against other houses and buildings. A recent renovation of the space resulted in the project we are featuring today, consisting of a beautiful wall of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/basalt/&quot;&gt;Grey Basalt Lynia Interlocking Tiles&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s take a quick look around this space and see how the homeowners created a modern, functional and beautiful interior stone courtyard in the midst of a concrete jungle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/12/San Francisco Interior Stone Tile Courtyard with Synthetic Turf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Grey Basalt Lynia Interlocking Tile Feature Wall in San Francisco Interior Courtyard&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we notice about this space is that its really quite small. For those of us that live in the suburbs, we tend to look at lot and yard size in fractions of an acre – this space is only about ten feet by fourteen feet open to the sky! Not exactly room for a pick up baseball game, but with any square footage at a premium in cities like San Francisco, utilizing this space to its full potential is the name of the game. The design and style of the space definitely leans modern, with not only the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/design-trends-when-it-comes-to-stone-smooth-is-in/&quot;&gt;smooth finish&lt;/a&gt; and pattern design of the Lynia Interlocking Natural stone tiles, but also with the predominant grey / white color scheme and sleek options selected for the railings and planter boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/12/San Francisco Interior Stone Tile Courtyard with Steps.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Grey Basalt Lynia Interlocking Tile Feature Wall in San Francisco Interior Courtyard showing tile pattern on wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the size of space that this customer had to work with, we really like the choice of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;Lynia Interlocking Tiles&lt;/a&gt; for the main wall. Each of the tile strips in the Lynia units are about 12” long and vary in height from around 1” to 2.5”. There are 9 strips per unit which are staggered to create an interlocking pattern from one unit to the next. The choice on this project to use a contrasting white color on the grout accentuates the pattern and tied in nicely with the bright white steps. A grout color that is a closer match to the natural stone tile downplays the pattern slightly but is also more forgiving from an installation standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/12/San Francisco Interior Stone Tile Courtyard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Grey Basalt Lynia Interlocking Tile Feature Wall in San Francisco Interior Courtyard with Synthetic Turf and a porch swing&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/stacked-stone-for-outdoor-living/&quot;&gt;natural stone tile is a great choice for an outdoor living space&lt;/a&gt;, the other element of this project that really catches most people’s eye is the synthetic turf. Due to limited direct sun exposure, trying to grow grass in a boxed in environment like this is difficult, not to mention the maintenance of caring for a yard, no matter how small. Synthetic turf is a great option here as it is durable, low maintenance, looks amazing, and offers a nice consistent color to contrast against the Grey Basalt color of the natural stone tiles on the wall. The planter boxes on the ledge above the wall bring actual plants into the space and round out a healthy dose of natural or at least “natural looking” materials into the space. It’s very easy to design these spaces with an abundance of hardscape products like brick pavers and knee walls, making a soft surface like synthetic turf even more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re outdoor space is big or small, enhancing the area with natural stone can dramatically alter and improve the look of the space.

Over the next couple weeks we are going to explore some specific chapters of the DSDM to learn more about industry standard for dimensional building stone with specific applicability to Norstone natural stone veneer products. Today we are discussing chapter 3, &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.naturalstoneinstitute.org/pub/2c34e470-d6f6-9967-5b03-11493b1b125e&quot;&gt;Dimension Stone Selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/10/Dimension Stone Design Manual Cover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cover of the Natural Stone Institute's Dimension Stone Design Manual&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A high level summary of Chapter 3 of the DSDM covers the physical attributes of stone (aesthetics and appearance), considerations for designing and using natural stone in a construction project, and guidelines for stone testing, sampling, cost and maintenance. Let’s quickly run through each of these topics and get a better understanding of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Attributes of Stone.&lt;/strong&gt; The physical attributes of stone are an important detail to understand when evaluating any natural stone product for use on a project. As the DSDM details out, there are a variety of different things to consider when thinking about the aesthetic and appearance. There are the obvious considerations, such as the visual attributes of the product like color, fit and finish of the stone, but as the DSDM states, just as important are the unseen attributes such as the strength and durability of the stone, which directly correlate to how appropriate a particular product is for the intended application. Furthermore, variegation and expected natural variation differ from source to source. Some of the most popular finishes we see in today’s market are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Polished. Most commonly defined by being so glossy, that you can see your reflection in the face of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Honed. Similar to Polished in that it’s smooth and silky to touch, but not glossy, more of a dull sheen where reflections are not noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Natural Cleft. Most common for wall cladding, and specifically highlighting the natural cut face of the stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Fine Rubbed. Newer to the market, but very popular — This is a flat finish, free of scratches, with no sheen whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Thermaled or Flamed. Planed surface, but rough textured due to the application of heat and water. Changes the look of the underlying stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/10/Dimension Stone Design Manual - Stone Finishes.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dimensional stone shown in polished and saw cut finishes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Norstone’s range of products are available in a variety of colors and finishes including our traditional split face rock panel systems as well as our polished modern veneer product series like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;Planc&lt;/a&gt; and Aksent 3D Panels. Nearly all of our products are durable enough that they are rated for both interior and exterior use, however all of our products are only rated for wall applications as they have not been designed nor tested for things like slip resistance, which are required for flooring materials for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suitability Considerations of your Selection.&lt;/strong&gt; Most of the considerations that the DSDM covers regarding designing and using natural stone in various projects focuses around making sure that the stone selected is a good fit for the intended usage. From making sure that the type of product being used, whether its loose stone, a modular panel system, or a tile, is a good fit for the application, to ensuring that the product is rated for the application it is intended to be used in (for example interior vs exterior, freeze / thaw, etc), there are lots of considerations that factor in to making sure the right stone is selected for the requirements and specifics of each job. This is an area where working with a knowledgeable expert, whether its the architect or designer, stone manufacturer’s rep, or industry expert can save the project time and money by making sure the product selected is suitable avoiding future early replacement of an incorrectly specified product. Some of the most important suitability factors to consider when selecting stone are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interior Only vs Exterior Rated Products. Almost all natural stone products can be used on interior applications, but only certain natural stone should be used in exterior applications based on freeze / thaw cycling, thermal expansion and contraction, and absorption and porosity of the stone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Water Resistance. Dense stone with a low absorption coefficient will produce the best results for exterior natural stone applications or interior applications subject to frequent water exposure such as fountains and showers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heavy vs Light Duty. Natural stone should be selected based on the expected traffic volume on the material. Areas with a heavy volume of traffic over or against the stone are best served by natural stone with maximum resistance such as granite and quartzite. Lower volume traffic areas where scratching and staining are less of a concern can explore less durable stone options such as highly polished finishes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/10/Dimension Stone Design Manual - Stone Suitability for Exterior Applications.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dimension Stone shown used in an exterior pool water feature&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stone Testing, Sampling, &amp;amp; Maintenance.&lt;/strong&gt; Chapter 3 of the Dimension Stone Design Manual then goes onto cover guidelines for stone testing, sampling, cost and maintenance. Important considerations when it comes to testing, sampling and maintenance are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ASTM testing. ASTM International develops and publishes technical standard for a wide range of products and services including natural stone building materials. Make sure a natural stone building material being considered for a project has been tested according to the relevant ASTM standards and those results are published or readily available from the manufacturer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sampling. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/the-importance-of-samples-in-any-stone-or-tile-project/&quot;&gt;Natural stone manufacturers should provide samples&lt;/a&gt; for purposes of evaluation and submittal for both commercial and residential projects. Often times multiple samples are needed to show the complete range of variation in a particular stone and for large projects a temporary “mock up” installation is usually performed to show both the stone and its natural variation but also to address site specific installation conditions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initial and Ongoing Maintenance. It is important to recognize that natural stone might have both initial and ongoing maintenance routines that need performed to maintain the natural beauty of the product. These maintenance guidelines should be published by the manufacturer and might include recommend ways to clean the stone of installation related stains and specific types of products that can or should not be used with the specific type of stone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sealing. Many types of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/sealing-natural-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;natural stone should be sealed&lt;/a&gt; dependent on the type of application where it is used. Sealers are available in a variety of different types including water and solvent based, topical and penetrating, and in a wide range of finishes such as matte or high gloss. Testing a sealer application on an off cut or sample of the stone is recommended as is setting up a maintenance schedule to reseal the stone per the sealer manufacturer’s recommended timeline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/03/10/Dimension Stone Design Manual - Stone Maintenance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Natural Stone Patio being cleaned as part of routine ongoing maintenance of natural stone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Norstone we take pride in being ready to answer our client’s questions about testing which we have had completed by independent labs for all of our products and maintenance, which we publish a guidelines on and have a wealth of experience with having manufactured and sold natural stone wall veneer panels for over 15 years. We also recognized early on that having a reliable and well thought out system to effectively sample products to our clients both near and far was going to be important to getting our products out in the marketplace so we developed sample kits as well individual samples that are both mounted to a thin MDF backer to ensure durability in both mailing and handling and functional with an info packed sticker on the back covering the highlights of what is most important to know about the product.&lt;/p&gt;

Getting started early makes sure that come peak summertime you’re going to be relaxing in a floating lounge instead of looking at a big hole in your backyard. This week’s featured project is a great inspiration as to how stacked stone can be used as part of a raised beam project. Let’s take a quick look at this project that used our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/thin-stone-veneer-panels/ochre/&quot;&gt;Ochre XL Rock Panels&lt;/a&gt; and see why and how it’s a great use of stacked stone for a pool water feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/02/25/Stacked Stone Pool Water Feature-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre XL Stacked Stone Panels used on a pool raised beam water feature with three tiers and three waterfalls&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that really catches our eye about this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/summer-s-here-jump-into-these-amazing-pools-designed-with-stacked-stone/&quot;&gt;stacked stone pool water feature&lt;/a&gt; is the design of the raised beam itself. The beam actually has three separate levels stretching almost the entire length of the back of this pool. The lowest level introduces the stacked stone above the waterline tile and then the two highest levels step up and include beautiful waterfalls that create a sheer curtain of water into the pool. This multi step design not only looks great, but it really creates more elevation contrast than you might be able to reasonably create with a single level raised beam feature. That higher elevation really accentuates the waterfalls and makes that an impressive feature of the stacked stone pool water feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A subtle but important part of the design of this stacked stone pool water feature is the decision to keep the waterline tile the same all around the entire pool and opt not to use the stacked stone all the way down to the waterline. Norstone Rock Panels can be used in submerged applications, but from a design standpoint and an ongoing maintenance standpoint it makes a lot more sense to use the same waterline tile as the rest of the pool. The tile in this application is a standard 5x5 ceramic pool tile that is nicely color matched to the brown and grey earth tones of the Ochre XL Stacked Stone Panels. The ceramic tiles will essentially be maintenance free whereas the stone would need sealed in a waterline application, and by maintaining the waterline tile consistent all the way around the pool there was not awkward vertical transition point between the much thinner ceramic tile and the thicker stacked stone panels that would have needed to be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/02/25/Stacked Stone Pool Water Feature with Waterfalls-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Side View of Norstone Ochre XL Stacked Stone Panels used on a pool raised beam water feature with three tiers showing miter cut outside corners&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talk a lot about our corner units and how easy they are, but are also always impressed when a contractor does a well executed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/miter-cut-vs-corner-unit/&quot;&gt;outside corner miter cut&lt;/a&gt; we see in this project. With probably only about 3 total lineal feet of outside corners on this project, miter cutting field units into outside corner units is not particularly tedious or time consuming, and as you can see when done well, a miter cut outside corner on a stacked stone wall looks great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/02/25/Stacked Stone Pool Raised Beam Water Feature.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre XL Stacked Stone Panels used on a pool raised beam with extensive landscaping&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final thing we really appreciate about this project is how well the planter bed behind the stacked stone raised beam was landscaped. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/application/pools/&quot;&gt;Stacked stone pool projects&lt;/a&gt; definitely fall into the “hardscape” category so it’s especially important to bring in other design elements to soften the space up. This was probably a little challenging with the higher than normal elevation of this stacked stone raised beam pool project, but a combination of tropical plants and a small palm tree do a fantastic job of softening up the hard look of the stone and paver coping while adding to the relaxed vibe that most backyard pools are looking to create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this quick tour around this fantastic stacked stone pool water feature has got you geared up and ready for some fun times this summer. Now is the time to get working on pool projects so that come summer you are enjoying your pool not waiting for it to be done.

In this week’s blog we’re going to explore some of the common uses of stacked stone panels for landscaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/02/19/Stacked Stone Landscaping Planter Wall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Grey Basalt Interlocking Tiles used on a multi level landscape planter wall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Planter walls are the most common application of stacked stone panels or natural stone veneer for landscaping. Raised planter beds, particularly those in commercial projects, are normally going to be built out of concrete block or poured in place concrete and so the stacked stone panels become an important part of the project to turn those planter bed walls from drab and dreary to something worth looking at. The photo above shows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/lynia-mosaic-tiles/&quot;&gt;Norstone Lynia Interlocking Tile&lt;/a&gt; in the Grey Basalt color used in extensively on planter walls in the common areas of a multi family housing project. We really like the multi level design of these planter walls which keeps the plants at ground level, knee height and waist height. Natural Stone is a great choice for this type of application because its durable and will stand up to the rigors of an exterior environment and since it is a natural product, creates good synergy in the design since the landscape beds are naturally abundant in vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/02/19/Stacked Stone Landscaping Fire Pit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Grey Basalt Interlocking Tiles used on a large rectangular fire pit&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fire pits are a common extension of the planter wall concept in that they are designed for outdoor use and are most often going to be found in the hardscape/ landscaping part of the design. One of the interesting things about using a stacked stone panel product like Norstone is that while &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/how-to-install-stacked-stone-on-curved-walls/&quot;&gt;stacked stone can be installed on radius walls&lt;/a&gt;, most fire pits are going to have too severe a radius to install a panel system product on.  Square and rectangular fire pits like the one we see here make up for that deficiency and look great particularly with gas burners that are often a long and skinny in shape. Most fire pits will be at knee level and below and should intentionally be spaced at an adequate distance from flammable material like plantings and vegetation. Most gas fire pits will come with some sort of “media” to cover up the burners, ranging from lava rock as seen in the example above to colored glass chips. The traditional look of stacked stone pairs will with the tumbled appearance of the lava rock whereas a more modern glass media will work well with a smooth face natural stone veneer product like Aksent 3D Panels or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/large-format-stone-veneer/&quot;&gt;Planc Large Format Tile Sets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/02/19/Stacked Stone Landscaping Retaining Wall-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ochre XLX used on a large retaining wall seperating an upper garden area and a lower stone patio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The king of the hill when it comes to stacked stone landscaping projects are retaining walls. Retaining walls generally are going to separate out two different elevation levels in the landscaping plan and thus form an important visual element of an exterior landscaping project. The retaining wall shown above using our Ochre XLX Series Rock Panels and features an upper yard and garden that gives way below to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/natural-stone-patios-designing-norstone-series/&quot;&gt;hardscaped natural stone patio&lt;/a&gt;. While the stacked stone panels are merely a decorative top layer on the actual retaining wall that is doing the heavy work of keeping the upper elevation held back, natural stone is a fantastic application for a retaining wall since it conveys strength and durability – everything you’d want in a retaining wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples of ways our stacked stone panels and natural stone veneer products can be used in landscaping applications. The great thing about these products is that they really allow you to think outside the box and use them in creative ways, so if you’re working on a landscaping project this Spring and want to learn more about how stacked stone panels might be a great addition to the job contact Norstone to get samples and start designing the landscaping project of your dreams!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">Believe it or not, Norstone Rock Panels started out as a landscaping product almost 20 years ago.

What’s really cool about Denver is that since its such a progressive and fast growing city you not only see the traditional large format and hand stacked stone look but you also see more contemporary and modern inspired natural stone all over the place. The coffee shop we are featuring as this week’s project profile is a nice mix of that old and new style – the stacked stone / ledge stone style texture of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/products/rock-panels/ivory/&quot;&gt;Ivory Standard Series Rock Panel&lt;/a&gt; is packaged in a sleek, geometric pattern that gives this fireplace a traditional texture in a modern design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/01/27/Ivory Stacked Stone Fireplace in Coffee Shop-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ivory Stacked Stone Rock Panels on a fireplace installation in a coffee shop in Denver, CO&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/gallery/rock-panels/ivory/&quot;&gt;Ivory stone&lt;/a&gt; is one of our most favorite colors – the creamy undertones give it much more warmth than our White Quartz color and the color movement down into the deep yellow and gold tones really gives the product a lot of character. We love the light and open color pallete and feel of the Coffee Shop with large windows letting in lots of natural light, high loft style ceilings and the light pear colored base wall colors. Retail tends to shy away from color palletes like this one but when someone is bold enough to take the risk it really creates something unique and special. Pale burnt orange casual lounge furniture serves as a nice accent color in the overall scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/01/27/Ivory Stacked Stone Fireplace.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ivory Stacked Stone Rock Panels installed on a fireplace as part of a retail space build out&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stone installation itself on this project is something many of our customers work with quite often – where the fireplace itself is flush against the wall, so when the stacked stone panels get applied they need to figure out what to do with the exposed edges. Many fireplaces stand out from the wall, anywhere from the width of a brick to much larger, creating a return from the face of the fireplace back to the main wall that can easily be handled using one of our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/norstone-classroom-session-working-corners-1/&quot;&gt;stacked stone finger jointed outside corner units&lt;/a&gt;. In applications like this one where the fireplace is already flush with the main wall, a great technique to cover the exposed edge of the stacked stone panel is to trim out the edges as has been done on this installation with a stainless steel trim piece. Stainless steel trim is a great option, especially if it matches the finish of the fireplace insert or fits in well with a modern inspired décor scheme, but more simple wooden trim, particularly if painted to match either the base boards or crown molding can look just as great and serve the purpose of covering the exposed edge of the stacked stone panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/2020/01/27/Ivory Stacked Stone Fireplace with Metal Trim.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Norstone Ivory Stacked Stone Rock Panels on a fireplace installation with metal trim pieces to cover the exposed edge of the panel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail build outs are a special type of project as most retail relies on heavy traffic in and out of the space. That heavy traffic,which is critical to the success of the retail establishment, also exacts a toll on the finishes in the space. Natural stone and especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/large-stone-veneer-mall-of-america/&quot;&gt;stacked stone is a great finish option for a retail build out&lt;/a&gt; due to its durability. The fireplace in this coffee shop will no doubt see plenty of use and abuse, whether that’s people bumping furniture, bags, shoes and boots, and sometimes even themselves into the stone, the finish here will absorb the blows and outlast most of the other finishes in the space. For a wall covering option with long term durability, a natural stone wall veneer option is an excellent choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this quick look around the fireplace out there at our favorite coffee shop in Denver was useful and informative. Some of the installation details of this job, particularly the stainless steel trim piece used to hide the cut edge of the panels is really well done and is a great solution for any project, residential or commercial. Whether you’re working on a fireplace, a retail build out or any other project where stacked stone is being considered give our design experts a call to learn more about our line up of amazing natural stacked stone veneers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rassan Grant</name></author><summary type="html">Our Ivory Stacked Stone Rock Panels are a great finish for the fireplace in this Denver area Coffee Shop to help keep the space light and bright.
