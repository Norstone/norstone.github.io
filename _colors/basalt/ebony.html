<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Stand Apart from the Crowd with Ebony Lynia IL Tiles</h3>
<p>Ebony Lynia IL Tiles are a bold move in both color and stone selection, pairing the nearly black shade of ebony with the unique cut and finish of basalt, a stone quarried from fields of cooled lava. Creating a stunning contrast against a white backdrop, these black mosaic tiles can be used effectively wherever a bold statement is required.</p>
