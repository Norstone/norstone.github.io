<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Capture the Earthy Essence of Ochre Blend XL</h3>
<p>Ochre Blend is an extremely versatile blend of neutral tones, combined with an eye catching contrast of deep reds, yellows, greens, and oranges. The XL series Rock Panel is particularly well suited to exterior work, often creating a symbiotic relationship
  with the earthy environment and color pallet in which it is used, making it our most popular color across all products.
