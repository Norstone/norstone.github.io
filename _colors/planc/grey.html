<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Color Consistency in Large Format Veneer</h3>
<p>Sourced from the same Basalt stone as our popular Lynia and Aksent series products, Ash Grey Basalt Planc is the perfect product for a design needing consistency in color and texture.  The nearly flawless surface texture of the Basalt stone sets this product apart from other Planc colors sourced from Lavastone and Quartz, while the honed texture serves up a truly luxurious finish that you have to touch and feel to truly experience.</p>
