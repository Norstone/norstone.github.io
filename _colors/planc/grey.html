<p>The Platinum Lavastone color is everything that's good about natural stone and modern design.  The grey color pallete is positioned just perfectly for today's trending color selections, but what really makes this product amazing is the unique surface texture of the Lavastone itself.  From subtle veining to more defined surface markings, Platinum Planc comes alive on the wall through the beauty of natural stone and is great choice for modern inspired design.<a href="/gallery/rock-panels/ochre">Complete Ochre Rock Panel Photo Gallery<img width="12" height="9" alt="arrows-img" title="arrows-img.png" class="arrow" src="/assets/images/theme/arrows-img.png"></a></p>
