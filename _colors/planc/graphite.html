<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Lavastone Refined</h3>
<p>Graphite Lavastone takes our popular Platinum Lavastone color and applies a honed finish to the surface, resulting in a color that is slightly darker and a surface that is smooth to the touch. This process of using a single stone and changing its appearance through the use of handmade finishes has endured through millenia. <br><br>Graphite retains the unique surface features that make Lavastone products an exceptionally modern and exotic style of building product.  We recommend sealing honed finishes as you'll find it hard to keep your hands off the silky smooth surface of this product.</p>
