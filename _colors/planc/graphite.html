<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Lavastone Refined</h3>
<p>Graphite Lavastone takes our popular Platinum Lavastone color and applies a honed finish to the surface, resulting in a color that is slightly darker and a surface that is smooth to the touch and retaining the unique surface features that make Lavastone products stand out.  We recommend sealing honed finishes as you'll find it hard to keep your hands off the silky smooth surface of this product.</p>
