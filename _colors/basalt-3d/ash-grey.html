<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Capture the Precision &amp; Clean Lines of the Grey Basalt Aksent 3D</h3>
<p>Grey Basalt is a medium bodied and consistent grey stone, which is very difficult to find in the industry. This color can fit well with a wide palette of cooler tones found most commonly in Contemporary Design. The Aksent 3D Tile itself is constructed to work particularly well for larger feature walls where long, refined lines are desired. Beloved by architects and designers, the Ash Grey Basalt 3D Tile is the perfect product for your modern design toolkit.</p>
