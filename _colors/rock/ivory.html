  <h3 class="medium color-secondary">What makes Ivory Stone Rock Panels Special?</h3>
  <p>Ask anybody at Norstone what their favorite color Rock Panel is and the Ivory Stone color is an answer you'll hear often. Our ivory stone is incredibly warm with subtle movement, making it one of those products that you notice something different every time you look at it. We take great pride in how the Ivory Stone Rock Panel straddles the line between being too white and monochromatic or too yellow or gold on the opposite end of the spectrum. Striking that perfect balance in a light color natural stone material is not easy, but has been perfected by Norstone over the many years of working with this ivory stone color range.</p>
  <p>At Norstone we aren't just a seller of stones, we take enormous pride in seeking out the best stone regions and quarries to work with and meticulously crafting natural stone products like our Ivory Stone Rock Panel that are equal parts building materials and works of art. We invite you to request a sample to learn more about our Ivory Stone Rock Panel and how it might be the perfect fit for your next wall veneer project.</p>
