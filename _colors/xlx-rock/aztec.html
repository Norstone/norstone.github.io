{% include color-slideshow.html %}
<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Lighten Things Up with Aztec XL</h3>
<p>A recent addition to our color line up, Aztec is an extremely popular blend of earth tones that is overall lighter in range than our most popular Ochre Blend color. Perfect for a neutral backdrop that exudes character through color blend and texture,
  Aztec is a quartzite based sandstone and should be primarily used for interior applications and exterior applications in non freeze / thaw climates.
