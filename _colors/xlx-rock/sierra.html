<h3 class="medium color-secondary">Grey, Blue & Gold - So Much More Than Another Grey Stone</h3>
<p>Grey is today's neutral color, and Sierra is an exciting blend of silver greys with just enough light colored earth tones to be both impartial on the color front, but still look incredibly exciting up on a wall.  With lots of texture and an umistakeable shine similar to our Aztec and Pearl colors, Sierra is just the thing for today's modern inspired design schemes.
