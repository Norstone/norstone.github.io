  <p>More people than ever know the term quartz from the increasingly popular solid surface countertop material, but few know that the quartz stone that we make a lot of our natural stone veneer and tile products isn't the same thing.  The difference is actually pretty substantial, so lets take a look at the difference between the two in this week's classroom session.</p>

  <p>The Norstone team based in Central Florida lived through Hurricane Irma over the past couple of days, thankfully with little damage to our homes and office.  While a few of us still are waiting on power to come back, this experience reminded us of a great project we worked on in 2011, the Revel Casino in Atlantic City, which experienced major damage caused by Hurricane / Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and which we'll profile in this week's blog.</p>

  <p>A lot of our customers ask us if they should seal their stone and the answer in almost every case is a resounding yes.  While its critically important in some installations, such as water features, a case for sealing natural stone veneer can be made for just about any project.  In this week's article let's take a closer look at why sealing might just be the most important part of your next natural stone veneer installation.</p>

  <p>All Natural Stone veneers are not the same.  Thickness, build quality and color consistency, not to mention service before and after the sale are just some of the things to consider when doing your homework on this type of product.  In this blog we dive into some key reasons why Norstone products differ from other products in the marketplace, and why ultimately that results in a superior product for the end user.</p>

  <p>Many installations don't end neatly into another wall or fixed object.  What do you do when your thin veneer installation ends right in the middle of a wall?  Natural Ends by Norstone are a great way to solve this problem.  Each "unit" has two "ends" left in the natural cleft, allowing an installation to be finished mid wall, without seeing, or finding a way to cover up the standard smooth saw cut ends of a field unit.</p>

  <p>Stacked stone is an age old building term that literally refers to constructing walls out of slabs of stone in various sizes. Romans used stacked stone walls in Europe to mark territories and some can still be found today. In New England you can find walls from early settlers that are moss covered and blending into tree lines.</p>

  <p>There are many differences between manmade tile products, like porcelains and ceramics, as compared to natural stone. One of the most noticeable is color variation – something that can be tightly controlled when tile is manufactured versus something Mother Nature dictates when it comes to natural stone. Learn more about why color can vary and figure out what type of product works best for you.</p>

  <p>Brick was and still is a very popular building material, particularily for residential fireplaces. Whether it's been a few years, or a few decades, the brick will look pretty much the same, but your tastes might have moved on. Stone Veneer is an excellent choice for refinishing over an existing brick substrate because it most often can be applied directly over the brick, minimizing the prepwork and allowing for a quick and easy transformation of the space. This article covers in detail some of things that you might consider when installing stone veneer over brick.</p>

So don't let an outside corner bring your stacked stone project to a screeching halt - Here's a handy guide that explains how using our Rock Panel series Outside Corner Unit will have you turning corners in no time.</p>
