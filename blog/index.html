  <p>Long a favorite of the Norstone team, our Ivory Blend color, which we have available in both our Standard Series and XL Series Rock Panels, was on the opposite side of the recent “grey” color trend dominating neutral design colors of the past couple years.  We’ve always described the Ivory as a “blended” color with ranges from whites / off whites, to creams / ivories, and including some yellows and golds.  We’ve been pleasantly surprised to hear from many clients during the Spring and early Summer months of 2017 on a renewed interest in this color with many projects already installed or in various stages of design and construction.

  <p>Over the years many of our customers have completed amazing feature walls using our stacked stone rock panel products, and on quite a few of those feature walls they choose to hang a flat screen TV.  When we first started making our products TVs weren’t flat and definitely didn’t get hung on a wall, but as technology evolved and our customers pushed the design limits of their entertainment space the question about how to hang a flat screen tv on a stacked stone wall was one we needed to answer.  Here’s a quick “how to” guide for hanging a flat screen TV on a stacked stone wall.

  <p>The beginning of May brings with it graduations across the country, filled with young people ready to take on the world.  Fond memories of our own university life were relived last fall when the Norstone team visited this cool installation at Drexel University featuring a large two sided fireplace adorned with our Ebony Basalt Interlocking Tile.  Having worked extensively with the design firm out of Austin, TX on this project, it was great to see our work come full circle from the initial sampling, design, bidding and construction, to now installed and being used and enjoyed by the students lucky enough to call this housing complex home.

  <p>Mesh backed tile is a product both admired and despised in the industry.  Manufacturers and consumers love it because it allows for intricate tile patterns to be assembled and installed creating beautiful tile mosaics that were previously only achieved via an artisan hand laying the pieces.  On the flip side, mesh backed tile can drive unqualified installers crazy if they don’t do simple things like plan accordingly for the pattern, or use quality setting materials and solid installation techniques to ensure a successful installation.  Here’s a detailed step by step guide on how to successfully install mesh backed tile like our Basalt Interlocking Series.

what’s trending in the tile and stone industry.  Here are some of our highlights from the past week.

  <p>Stone, whether it be in panels or tiles, has always been a favorite material for designers working on multifamily projects.  The obvious durability of the product makes sure the design stays looking crisp over time, which is especially important in multi family projects which tend to get a lot more usage than residential projects but might not have the same level of maintenance and upkeep budgeted as a commercial project.  We got the opportunity to work with the design team on this large multifamily projects located on the site of the former train depot between Alexandria and Arlington, VA.  Looking to target young professionals in the Metro D.C. Area, the design team was evoked a modern style and assembled amenities that would matter to the target audience.  Our Ash Grey Basalt Interlocking Tiles were selected and installed in various places throughout the shared outdoor living space.  Let's take a look at how the product was expertly used throughout these spaces and features.

  <p>One of the things we love about our products is that over the years we’ve gotten to work with lots of amazing designers, as well as bunches of homeowners, who each have their own unique vision of what they’re trying to achieve with their project. The customer service and attention to detail we, and our amazing team of distributors and dealers, provide is something you simply don’t get when buying stone products through big box stores or discount flooring centers. The ones that are especially memorable are the clients that use the product in a new and totally unique way that even takes us by surprise! Stacked stone and stone veneer is always going to be a major design trend on our most popular projects like fireplaces and backsplashes, but these projects below, as well as many others, inspire us with their creative use of stone veneer.

  <p>When Norstone first introduced its Aztec XL Series panel to the market we needed some great photography of an installation to put on our website and we had to look no further than the kitchen backsplash of one of our amazing sales people for just the right opportunity. Even though the project was a complete kitchen renovation, including the removal of walls, leveling out a sunken breakfast nook, and the complete tear out and reconfiguration of all cabinets and appliances, the backsplash was definitely not an afterthought. Having the unique experience and background of helping our clients day in and day out plan for their own kitchen renovations, she knew that the backsplash would tie all the other materials together and was an important piece of the design puzzle of this space.

  <p>Here at Norstone we’re always been cognizant of lighting and how it impacts the look of our products on our customer’s walls. The first thing most people think of in terms of lighting is the color of the light the space will have. Is it natural sunlight from a window, or LED, Fluorescent, Halogen or Incandescent from a fixture? Each of these light sources is going to have a different shade, ranging from the yellow tinge of an incandescent to the ultra pure white of some LEDs, and can make a significant impact on how stone veneer looks once installed. What we want to talk about today is not just the color of the light shining down on that stone, but the fixture itself. A simple web search will net you pages and pages of different light fixtures in every shape, size, color, and material, so with endless options, let’s cut through some of that clutter and share with you some of our favorite pairings of lighting fixtures and stone veneer.

  <p>Mixing and matching colors is something any good designer can hang their hat on. Coordinating a counter top to cabinet color, or flooring to an accent wall is an everyday thing. But it’s not everyday you see a designer, like the team over at Springhaus Designs in Ft. Collins, CO, mix two colors and two materials on one fireplace – which they did on this recently completed front range home. Using our Basalt Grey 3D Panel for the sides and corners, meeting up with a vertical band of lighter colored natural stone tiles, this fireplace oozes a modern feel with the smooth finishes, geometric 3D look, and color pallete.

  <p>Some things can be bought sight unseen – that cool looking hat you found online, a new cast iron skillet that has great reviews on Amazon, or new tablet you’ve researched that meets your needs. Other things such as that new guitar you want to get a chance to play before buying, some accent pillows you really need to make sure fit your color scheme, or a new vehicle that you’ll want to take for a test drive and check out the truck space are examples of items better suited to be seen, touched, or experienced in person prior to making the decision to buy. Having spent the last decade working with our customers to supply stacked stone to projects all over North America and the Caribbean we can definitively state that tile and stone is one of this things that you want to see in person before buying. Let’s go deep into some of the reasons why and what are the pitfalls seeing samples in person can help you avoid.

  <p>If you wonder into your local home improvement or discount tile and flooring store to pick up supplies for your next tile or stone veneer project, you’ll likely find yourself at some point in the setting materials aisle confused by what you’re seeing. There’s thinset, mastic, mortars, epoxies, and additives that are available in a different variety of formats like pre-mixed and bucketed, powder and liquid. Some products are polymer modified, others have or require a latex additive. What does all this mean, and what is the right product for a stacked stone tile installation? Let’s take a look at these different types of setting materials and learn more about what each type is best suited for.

  <p>Austin, for those that have never been, is a hidden gem of a city in the Lonestar State. Smaller and a good bit easier to navigate than Dallas and Houston, Austin is the capital of Texas, home to the University of Texas, and within quick driving distance of Lake Travis and the Hill Country region offering its residents plenty of opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors. Several high tech industries call Austin home, which along with the University and government sector and have brought an intellectual vibe to the city that is often showcased in the design of its buildings and homes.

  <p>Here at Norstone we’ve been noticing a trend in terms of design towards smoother finished products and away from more textured materials. We get the chance to speak and work with some of the top architects and designers in the country on a daily basis and can see this reflective in the products they are requesting samples of and the projects they are working on. And it’s not just what we see come across our desks, walking outside any of our offices, whether that’s in Orlando, Brooklyn, or LA, we see new residential and commercial construction embracing the smooth trend. Let’s take a quick look at how some of the designers we work with are using Norstone products to follow this popular trend.

    <h3><a href="https://www.norstoneusa.com/blog/what-makes-norstone-different-a-lot/" class="x-large color-primary">What Makes Norstone Different - A LOT!</a>
    <p>Posted on December 19</p>
  </header>
  <img src="https://www.norstoneusa.com/assets/images/Ochre7.jpg" alt="Post Image" title="Post Image" />
  <p>What Makes Norstone Different - A LOT!Durability -&nbsp;Most of the time, other rock panels on the market are mass produced in China or Indonesia. You should note that resellers and other brands from China etc use glue, instead of a 2 part epoxy like Norstone, to adhere their stones to save on cost, therefore sacrificing quality control. This typically leads to more breakage, even when cutting the panels during installation.  Furthermore, over time, the bond from glue can deteriorate and cause stones to come loose from the panel and possibly fall off the application.  I've seen this happen all around town.  From feature walls in restaurants to columns in my neighborhood, rocks will fall off the application due to the glue breaking down.  The 2-part epoxy prevents this for happening by creating a very strong bond that will hold up over time.  If you throw one of our panels on the ground, the stone will break before the seam does.  Seams -&nbsp;Also, it is very important for manufacturers to use highly calibrated machinery to cut the panels precisely or you will have poorly cut edges.  Due to mass production in these Chinese facilities, without proper calibration or timely blade changes, this often occurs with their product.  This may not be noticeable at a glance, but you will end up with unwanted, highly visible seams  This is hard to tell from individual pieces you might see in a showroom so the best way to make sure this will not happen is to see as many pictures as possible of completed projects.  Coloring -&nbsp;Finally, as a result of mass production, the color sample you see in the showroom may not match the color you receive for your order.  There are no guarantees that the full order will match or have come from the same batch, therefore leading to inconsistent coloring on the overall results.  Also, with light colors like White Quartz, substantial variations are common.  This means that it is very common to see tan, pink and even grey pieces within the white.  With our stone, we make sure that your order all comes from the same batch of quarries so your colors will be consistent.  This is how we store them in the warehouse so there is no mistake.  Also, while our product is natural stone and there can be some variations, I would not say there is not a substantial amount.  I would say the variations are very low and if any.We address all of the issues mentioned above to insure that our product stands up over time without any maintenance required.  Our panels are designed and calibrated to fit together effortlessly to create a seamless, beautiful application with constant coloring throughout.  This is an investment and we ultimately want you to be happy with your final outcome.

    <p>Posted on December 19</p>

  <img src="https://www.norstoneusa.com/assets/images/PRODUCT-SHOT---Ochre---Natural-End.jpg" alt="Post Image" title="Post Image" />
  <p>This past summer Norstone rolled out Natural Ends as the latest accessory to their Standard Series Rock Panel, XL Rock Panel, and 3D Basalt Panel lines. The Natural End allows the designer and installer to start or stop a rock panel installation mid wall, terminating the short side of the panel with a natural cleft stone facing. This eliminates the need to terminate an installation into a wall, or use a cap piece to cover the saw cut ends of a standard panel.&nbsp;Natural Ends are an important part of a thin stone veneer installation as they provide a seamless look on that critical side angle view of an installation. Without a natural end the illusion that the stone is a thick bed veneer masonry, that the face of the thin stone panel is designed to create, is lost. Our production unit carefully finds the most ideal stones for this purpose and uses rock splitting tools and techniques to create as consistent of a cleft finish from the face of the stone to the Natural End side as possible.Natural ends are packed two pieces per unit, where one piece is appx 6” tall x 8” long, and the other piece is appx 6” tall x 16” long. Each of the pieces have one 6” vertical side in the natural end format, and the opposing side is the standard saw cut end to match up against any standard field or corner unit in the same series. Natural Ends are packed 4 units per box, which equates out to 4 lineal feet of natural end, and covers approximately 4 sq ft of wall coverage when used without cutting. Natural Ends are currently available in all colors of Standard Rock Panel, XL Rock Pane, and 3D Panel Lines.Contact your local distributor or Norstone rep to learn more about using Natural Ends on your next stacked stone veneer project.

  <p>Stacked stone is an age old building term that literally refers to constructing walls out of slabs of stone in various sizes. Romans used stacked stone walls in Europe to mark territories and some can still be found today. In New England you can find walls from early settlers that are moss covered and blending into tree lines.

  <p>Any time it comes to decorating a kitchen - appliances, cabinets and the hard surfaces are where all of the fun is. And come to think of it, that’s about all a kitchen really is period. It’s also foot to foot the most expensive room to design, build or remodel, so we are talking about a major investment even if it’s the only space you are working on. At Norstone, we work with our customers everyday on stacked stone backsplashes that range in looks from rustic, using our Ochre Rock Panels, to uber – modern, with our Basalt Interlocking Tiles. A trend we’re seeing lots of kitchens using is to extend their countertop surface to the backsplash. This can be used to create a more dynamic and bold looking kitchen, create a durable backsplash, and highlight the beauty of the material on a vertical surface.

  <p>If you’re thinking that a hard surface is a good option for your next wall covering project, one of the first decisions you’ll likely end up making is whether to go with a natural product, like a stone veneer, or a manmade product, like a porcelain or ceramic wall tile. One of the biggest differences between the two is with respect to color variation, so let’s dig a little deeper into each of these products to understand what the advantages are for each.

  <p>The starting point of any stone veneer column job is going to be the outside corner.Most stone veneer manufacturers now have outside corner units that are designed to turn outside corners, offer varying degrees of a seamless look at the corner itself, and make a natural stone column project easier to do today than ever before. Depending on the manufacturer, options for outside corners in the stone veneer industry range from preassembled corner units, simple dovetail corners, and more complex staggered patterns, like Norstone’s Interlocking Finger Jointed Corner. Let’s take a quick look at each type of corner and the pros and cons of each.

  <p> The authenticity of the materials we use in our environments is a reflection of our ideas and who we are. Perhaps one of the most interesting trends we’re seeing in today’s ever changing marketplace is that personalized design and unique habitats matter more to our customers than ever before. Not more than 10 to 15 years ago, interior design and remodeling was considerably less complicated – not because building was any less complex, but simply because most home buyers were trying to create a similar look. Unique materials like natural stone were far too expensive for general use and materials such as marble countertops for example were only seen in high-end projects. This is perhaps one of the great feats that Norstone has brought to bare – Because our product simplifies the installation side of a project, we are able to make design ideas such as a natural stone feature wall or personal water feature far more accessible to the everyday project than ever before. This is just one of the many great natural stone materials on the market today that can allow you to flex your design muscle and give your project that strong personal signature you’re looking for to set it apart.

  <p>Natural stone is one of the oldest and most durable building materials in the world, and while manmade hard surfaces like ceramic and porcelain offer incredible ease of use, don’t discount natural stone because you think it might be hard to clean or keep up. A combination of selecting the right type of natural stone for your application, and some knowledge of natural stone care is all you need to enjoy a beautiful natural product and not worry about causing permanent damage.
