When a blockbuster budget to re-do the kitchen or bathrooms isn't in the cards, or if you've been diligent and have some money leftover at the end of a big renovation, look no further than the fireplace for smaller project that can significantly change the way a room looks and feels, and if done correctly, give you a great return on your renovation dollars.</p>

  <p>All Natural Stone veneers are not the same.  Thickness, build quality and color consistency, not to mention service before and after the sale are just some of the things to consider when doing your homework on this type of product.  In this blog we dive into some key reasons why Norstone products differ from other products in the marketplace, and why ultimately that results in a superior product for the end user.</p>

  <p>Many installations don't end neatly into another wall or fixed object.  What do you do when your thin veneer installation ends right in the middle of a wall?  Natural Ends by Norstone are a great way to solve this problem.  Each "unit" has two "ends" left in the natural cleft, allowing an installation to be finished mid wall, without seeing, or finding a way to cover up the standard smooth saw cut ends of a field unit.</p>

Let us show you how these and other stains can be cleaned on natural stone surfaces.</p>

  <p>When designing a kitchen, there are a lot of little details to think about - cabinets, countertops, appliances, island or no island, flooring and more. The one detail that is often overlooked, or saved for last, is the backsplash - but it shouldn't be!  The backsplash can tie all the little details together and be the finishing touch on the kitchen.
Here are a few design ideas using natural stone as a non traditional backsplash medium.</p>

  <p>There comes a point in most stone veneer projects where the stone will need to go around an outside corner to either continue along, or terminate into another wall or structure. Calculating the right mix of field and corner units for your project the first time around is a critical step to staying on time and in budget.
So don't let an outside corner bring your stacked stone project to a screeching halt - Here's a handy guide that explains how using our Rock Panel series Outside Corner Unit will have you turning corners in no time.</p>

  <p>Got Dimensions? This is a quick tutorial on everything you need to know to measure your project for a stone veneer application.
One of the first steps in any project is going to be measuring the space and determining material requirements in square feet (sq ft). Whether you are working on a fireplace, backsplash, or feature wall, measuring the pertinent dimensions can be broken down into a few easy steps.
Let's take a look at them here.</p>

  <p>Of all the rock panels,the Ochre Blend has the most color variation to it. You will find shades of gray, rust and beige. If you are lucky, you will even receive panels with hints of blue and green. Since the Ochre is made up of a combination of sedimentary rock and quartz, you will also notice that it has a slight gold glimmer that will catch your eye.
This can be your guide to designing with this crowd favorite, helping you elevate your project from ordinary to extraordinary.</p>
